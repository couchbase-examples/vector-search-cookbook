        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Voyage](https://www.voyageai.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as the language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

        "# Perform Semantic Search\n",
        "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

The 17-year-old made headlines around the world when he reached the tournament final in January, where he lost to Luke Humphries. Starting this campaign on Saturday, Littler was millimetres away from a nine-darter when he missed double 12 as he blew Meikle away in the fourth and final set of the second-round match. Littler was overcome with emotion at the end, cutting short his on-stage interview. \"It was probably the toughest game I've ever played. I had to fight until the end,\" he said later in a news conference. \"As soon as the question came on stage and then boom, the tears came. It was just a bit too much to speak on stage. \"It is the worst game I have played. I have never felt anything like that tonight.\" Admitting to nerves during the match, he told Sky Sports: \"Yes, probably the biggest time it's hit me. Coming into it I was fine, but as soon as [referee] George Noble said 'game on', I couldn't throw them.\" Littler started slowly against Meikle, who had two darts for the opening set, but he took the lead by twice hitting double 20. Meikle did not look overawed against his fellow Englishman and levelled, but Littler won the third set and exploded into life in the fourth. The tournament favourite hit four maximum 180s as he clinched three straight legs in 11, 10 and 11 darts for a record set average, and 100.85 overall. Meanwhile, two seeds crashed out on Saturday night – five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld lost to Welshman Nick Kenny, while England's Ryan Joyce beat Danny Noppert. Australian Damon Heta was another to narrowly miss out on a nine-darter, just failing on double 12 when throwing for the match in a 3-1 win over Connor Scutt. Ninth seed Heta hit four 100-plus checkouts to come from a set down against Scutt in a match in which both men averaged more than 97.\n",

The teenager will next play after Christmas against European Championship winner Ritchie Edhouse, the 29th seed, or Ian White, and is seeded to meet Humphries in the semi-finals. Having entered last year's event ranked 164th, Littler is up to fourth in the world and will go to number two if he reaches the final again this time. He has won 10 titles in his debut professional year, including the Premier League and Grand Slam of Darts. After reaching the World Championship final as a debutant aged just 16, Littler's life has been transformed and interest in darts has rocketed. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. This Christmas, more than 100,000 children are expected to be opening Littler-branded magnetic dartboards as presents. His impact has helped double the number of junior academies and has prompted plans to expand the World Championship.

With his nickname 'The Nuke' on his purple and yellow shirt and the Alexandra Palace crowd belting out his walk-on song, Pitbull's tune Greenlight, he became an instant hit. Electric on the stage, calm off it. The down-to-earth teenager celebrated with a kebab and computer games. \"We've been watching his progress since he was about seven. He was on our radar, but we never anticipated what would happen. The next thing we know 'Littlermania' is spreading everywhere,\" PDC president Barry Hearn told BBC Sport. A peak TV audience of 3.7 million people watched the final - easily Sky's biggest figure for a non-football sporting event. The teenager from Warrington in Cheshire was too young to legally drive or drink alcohol, but earned £200,000 for finishing second - part of £1m prize money in his first year as a professional - and an invitation to the elite Premier League competition. He turned 17 later in January but was he too young for the demanding event over 17 Thursday nights in 17 locations? He ended up winning the whole thing, and hit a nine-dart finish against Humphries in the final. From Bahrain to Wolverhampton, Littler claimed 10 titles in 2024 and is now eyeing the World Championship.\n",

In 12 months, Littler's Instagram followers have risen from 4,000 to 1.3m. Commercial backers include a clothing range, cereal firm and train company and he will appear in a reboot of the TV darts show Bullseye. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. On the back of his success, Littler darts, boards, cabinets, shirts are being snapped up in big numbers. \"This Christmas the junior magnetic dartboard is selling out, we're talking over 100,000. They're 20 quid and a great introduction for young children,\" said Garry Plummer, the boss of sponsors Target Darts, who first signed a deal with Littler's family when he was aged 12. \"All the toy shops want it, they all want him - 17, clean, doesn't drink, wonderful.\"\n",

There are 115 dedicated groups offering youngsters equipment, tournaments and a place to develop, with bases including Australia, Bulgaria, Greece, Norway, USA and Mongolia. \"We've seen so many inquiries from around the world, it's been such a boom. It took us 14 years to get 1,600 members and within 12 months we have over 3,000, and waiting lists,\" said Brown. \"When I played darts as a child, I was quite embarrassed to tell my friends what my hobby was. All these kids playing darts now are pretty popular at school. It's a bit rock 'n roll and recognised as a cool thing to do.\" Plans are being hatched to extend the World Championship by four days and increase the number of players from 96 to 128. That will boost the number of tickets available by 25,000 to 115,000 but Hearn reckons he could sell three times as many. He says Saudi Arabia wants to host a tournament, which is likely to happen if no-alcohol regulations are relaxed. \"They will change their rules in the next 12 months probably for certain areas having alcohol, and we'll take darts there and have a party in Saudi,\" he said. \"When I got involved in darts, the total prize money was something like £300,000 for the year. This year it will go to £20m. I expect in five years' time, we'll be playing for £40m.\"\n",

Littler is currently fourth in the world rankings, although that is based on a two-year Order of Merit. There have been suggestions from others the spotlight on the teenager means world number one Humphries, 29, has been denied the coverage he deserves, but no darts player has made a mark at such a young age as Littler. \"Luke Humphries is another fabulous player who is going to be around for years. Sport is a very brutal world. It is about winning and claiming the high ground. There will be envy around,\" Hearn said. \"Luke Littler is the next Tiger Woods for darts so they better get used to it, and the only way to compete is to get better.\" World number 38 Martin Lukeman was awestruck as he described facing a peak Littler after being crushed 16-3 in the Grand Slam final, with the teenager winning 15 consecutive legs. \"I can't compete with that, it was like Godly. He was relentless, he is so good it's ridiculous,\" he said. Lukeman can still see the benefits he brings, adding: \"What he's done for the sport is brilliant. If it wasn't for him, our wages wouldn't be going up. There's more sponsors, more money coming in, all good.\" Hearn feels future competition may come from players even younger than Littler. \"I watched a 10-year-old a few months ago who averaged 104.89 and checked out a 4-3 win with a 136 finish. They smell the money, the fame and put the hard work in,\" he said. How much better Littler can get is guesswork, although Plummer believes he wants to reach new heights. \"He never says 'how good was I?' But I think he wants to break records and beat Phil Taylor's 16 World Championships and 16 World Matchplay titles,\" he said. \"He's young enough to do it.\" A version of this article was originally published on 29 November.\n",

Scotland's Wright, the 2020 and 2022 winner, has been out of form this year, but overcame Wesley Plaisier 3-1 in the second round at Alexandra Palace in London. \"It was this crowd that got me through, they wanted me to win. I thank you all,\" said Wright. Meikle came from a set down to claim a 3-2 victory in his first-round match against Sherrock, who was the first woman to win matches at the tournament five years ago. The 28-year-old will now play on Saturday against Littler, who was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year and runner-up in the main award to athlete Keely Hodgkinson on Tuesday night. Littler, 17, will be competing on the Ally Pally stage for the first time since his rise to stardom when finishing runner-up in January's world final to Luke Humphries. Earlier on Tuesday, World Grand Prix champion Mike de Decker – the 24th seed - suffered a surprise defeat to Luke Woodhouse in the second round. He is the second seed to exit following 16th seed James Wade's defeat on Monday to Jermaine Wattimena, who meets Wright in round three.

Sporting a purple mohawk and festive outfit, crowd favourite 'Snakebite' showed glimpses of his best to win the first set and survived eight set darts to go 2-0 ahead. He lost the next but Dutchman Plaisier missed two more set darts in the fourth and Wright seized his opportunity. \"Wesley had his chances but he missed them and I took them,\" he said. \"He's got his tour card and he's going to be a dangerous player next year for all the players playing against him.\" Sherrock, 30, fought back from 2-1 down to force a decider against her English compatriot Meikle. She then narrowly missed the bull to take out 170 in the fourth leg before left-hander Meikle held his nerve to hit double 18 for a 96 finish to seal a hard-fought success. \"I felt under pressure from the start and to come through feels unbelievable,\" said Meikle. \"It's an unbelievable prize to play Luke here on this stage. It's the biggest stage of them all. I'm so happy.\" World number 81 Jeffrey de Graaf, who was born in the Netherlands but now represents Sweden, looked in trouble against Rashad Sweeting before prevailing 3-1.

The three-time world champion has had a tough year by his standards, having fallen behind Luke Littler and Luke Humphries, so a relatively stress-free opening match at Alexandra Palace was just what was needed. Hurrell, 40, offered some resistance early on when taking the opening leg of the match, but he would win just two more as Van Gerwen proved far too strong. The third-seeded Dutchman averaged 94.85, took out two three-figure checkouts and hit 50% of his doubles - with six of his nine misses coming in one scrappy leg. Van Gerwen, 35, will now face either Brendan Dolan or Lok Yin Lee in the third round.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"I think I played OK,\" Van Gerwen told Sky Sports after his match. \"Of course, I was a bit nervous. Like everyone knows it's been a tough year for me. \"Overall, it was a good performance. I was confident. I won the game, that's the main thing.\" Also on Friday night, Germany's Florian Hempel showed why he loves playing on the Alexandra Palace stage with a thrilling 3-1 victory in a high-quality contest against Jeffrey de Zwaan. Both men hit seven 180s in a match played at a fast and furious pace, but 34-year-old Hempel's superior doubles gave him a fourth straight first-round victory in the competition. Hempel moves on to a tie with 26th seed Daryl Gurney but it was a damaging loss for De Zwaan, 28, who came through a late qualifier in November and needed a good run here to keep his PDC tour card for next season. Mickey Mansell earned a second-round date with world number seven Jonny Clayton after a scrappy 3-1 win over Japan's Tomoya Goto, while Dylan Slevin came through an all-Irish tie against William O'Connor to progress to a meeting with Dimitri van den Bergh.\n",

            "In the afternoon session, Stephen Bunting came from behind to beat Kai Gotthardt 3-1 and book his place in the third round. Englishman Bunting, ranked eighth in the world, dropped the first set and almost went 2-0 down in the match before staging an impressive recovery. Tournament debutant Gotthardt missed three darts at double eight to win the second set, allowing Bunting to take out double 10 to level the match before powering away to victory by winning the third and fourth sets without losing a leg. Victory for \"The Bullet\" sets up a last 32 meeting with the winner of Dirk van Duijvenbode's meeting with Madars Razma after Christmas. Should Bunting progress further, he is seeded to face world number one and defending world champion Luke Humphries in the quarter-finals on New Year's Day. Elsewhere in Friday afternoon's session, the Dutch duo of Alexander Merkx and Wessel Nijman advanced to the second round with wins over Stephen Burton and Cameron Carolissen respectively. England's Ian White was handed a walkover victory against Sandro Eric Sosing of the Philippines. Sosing withdrew from the competition on medical grounds and was taken to hospital following chest pains.\n",

            "Former champion Michael Smith has been sensationally knocked out of the PDC World Championship by Kevin Doets. Englishman Smith, seeded second, went down 3-2 after a pulsating second-round duel at Alexandra Palace in London. Dutchman Doets prevailed 6-4 in the deciding set, despite checkouts of 123, 84, 94 and 76 from 2023 champion Smith. \"This was the most stressful game of my life and I've won it, yes,\" said world number 51 Doets. \"I felt if I can keep my focus, I won't lose this. It was so very tight, to get over the line was amazing.\" Doets, 26, took the first set and fought back after going 2-1 down to avenge his narrow defeat to Smith at the same stage last year. Having lost in the second round of the tournament for the first time since 2020, the 34-year-old Smith will now drop to at least 15 in the rankings.\n",

German debutant Springer, second on this year's development tour, won all three legs in the opening set before the match exploded into life. Williams hit back, showing his old swagger as he went ahead after a sensational third set which featured seven 180s. The 34-year-old edged the deciding leg in the fourth and will meet 2018 champion Rob Cross in round two on Monday. Nick Kenny delighted the Ally Pally crowd with a fabulous 170 finish to seal a 3-0 victory in round one over American Stowe Buntz.

Rydz beat Croatian Romeo Grbavac 3-0, recording the tournament's highest average first-round match average in its current 96-player format. It was the competition's 26th highest match average overall and comfortably the best so far at the 2025 event. The previous record was held by teenager Luke Littler, who scored 106.12 at this stage last year. Rydz, from Bedlington in Northumberland, meets Germany's Martin Schindler in the second round on Sunday evening. The afternoon session concluded with Germany's 27th seed Clemens being beaten by Owen, who is ranked 50 places below him. Owen recorded a 3-1 victory, his second in a matter of days, to reach the third round, which begins on 27 December. Hong Kong's Lok Yin Lee came from a set down to beat Chris Landman 3-1 after winning nine straight legs. Lee will face Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan in round two on Saturday afternoon.

The Dutchman became the first player to seal a perfect leg in the tournament since Michael Smith did so on the way to beating Michael van Gerwen in the 2023 final. Kist, the 2012 BDO world champion at Lakeside, collects £60,000 for the feat, with the same amount being awarded by sponsors to a charity and to one spectator inside Alexandra Palace in London. The 38-year-old's brilliant finish sealed the opening set, but his Latvian opponent bounced back to win 3-1. Darts is one of the few sports that can measure perfection; snooker has the 147 maximum break, golf has the hole-in-one, darts has the nine-dart finish. Kist scored two maximum 180s to leave a 141 checkout which he completed with a double 12, to the delight of more than 3,000 spectators. The English 12th seed, who has been troubled by wrist and back injuries, could next play Andrew Gilding in the third round - which begins on 27 December - should Gilding beat the winner of Martin Lukeman's match against qualifier Nitin Kumar. Aspinall faces a tough task to reach the last four again, with 2018 champion Rob Cross and 2024 runner-up Luke Littler both in his side of the draw.\n",

            "Kist - who was knocked out of last year's tournament by teenager Littler - will still earn a bigger cheque than he would have got for a routine run to the quarter-finals. His nine-darter was the 15th in the history of the championship and first since the greatest leg in darts history when Smith struck, moments after Van Gerwen just missed his attempt. Darts fan Kris, a railway worker from Sutton in south London, was the random spectator picked out to receive £60,000, with Prostate Cancer UK getting the same sum from tournament sponsors Paddy Power. \"I'm speechless to be honest. I didn't expect it to happen to me,\" Kris said. \"This was a birthday present so it makes it even better. My grandad got me tickets. It was just a normal day - I came here after work.\" Kist said: \"Hitting the double 12 felt amazing. It was a lovely moment for everyone and I hope Kris enjoys the money. Maybe I will go on vacation next month.\" Earlier, Jim Williams was favourite against Paolo Nebrida but lost 3-2 in an epic lasting more than an hour. The Filipino took a surprise 2-1 lead and Williams only went ahead for the first time in the opening leg of the deciding set. The Welshman looked on course for victory but missed five match darts.

Ritchie Edhouse, Dirk van Duijvenbode and Martin Schindler were the other seeds beaten on day eight. England's Callan Rydz, who hit a record first-round average of 107.06 on Thursday, followed up with a 3-0 win over 23rd seed Schindler on Sunday. The German missed double 12 for a nine-darter in the first set – the third player to do so in 24 hours after Luke Littler and Damon Heta – and ended up losing the leg.

Nijman, who has previously served a ban for breaching betting and anti-corruption rules, had been billed as favourite beforehand to beat 23rd seed Cullen. \"Honestly, the media attention that Wessel's got, again this is not a reflection on him,\" Cullen said. \"He seems like a fantastic kid, he's been caught up in a few things beforehand, but he's served his time and he's held his hands up, like a lot haven't. \"I think the way I've been treated probably with the media and things like that - I know you guys have no control over the bookies - I've been shown no respect, so I won't be showing any respect to any of you guys tonight. \"I'm going to go home. Cheers.\" Ian 'Diamond' White beat European champion and 29th seed Edhouse 3-1 and will face teenage star Littler in the next round. White, born in the same Cheshire town as the 17-year-old, acknowledged he would need to up his game in round three. Asked if he knew who was waiting for him, White joked: \"Yeah, Runcorn's number two. I'm from Runcorn and I'm number one.\" Ryan Searle started Sunday afternoon's action off with a 10-dart leg and went on to beat Matt Campbell 3-0, while Latvian Madars Razma defeated 25th seed Van Duijvenbode 3-1.
