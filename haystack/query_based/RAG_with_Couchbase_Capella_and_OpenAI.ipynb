    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application with Haystack orchestrating OpenAI models and Couchbase Capella. We will use the [gpt-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o) model for response generation and the [text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models) model for generating embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a RAG system using:\n",
    "- The [BBC News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime) containing news articles\n",
    "- Couchbase Capella Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes for vector search\n",
    "- Haystack framework for the RAG pipeline\n",
    "- OpenAI for embeddings and text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage Couchbase's Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes to enable efficient semantic search at scale. Hyperscale indexes prioritize high-throughput vector similarity across billions of vectors with a compact on-disk footprint, while Composite indexes blend scalar predicates with a vector column to narrow candidate sets before similarity search. For a deeper dive into how these indexes work, see the [overview of Capella vector indexes](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/vectors-and-indexes-overview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial shows how to combine OpenAI Services and Haystack with Couchbase's Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes to deliver a production-ready RAG workflow."

    "### Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a multi-node Capella cluster running the Data, Query, Index, and Search services.\n",
    "* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.\n",
    "* [Allow access](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI Models Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the RAG application, we need an embedding model to ingest the documents for Vector Search and a large language model (LLM) for generating the responses based on the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation, we'll use OpenAI's models which provide state-of-the-art performance for both embeddings and text generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Model**: We'll use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model, which provides high-quality embeddings with 3,072 dimensions for semantic search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Language Model**: We'll use OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model for generating responses based on the retrieved context. This model offers excellent reasoning capabilities and can handle complex queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites for OpenAI Integration**:\n",
    "* Create an OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)\n",
    "* Generate an API key from your OpenAI dashboard\n",
    "* Ensure you have sufficient credits or a valid payment method set up\n",
    "* Set up your API key as an environment variable or input it securely in the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about OpenAI's models and pricing, please refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\n"

    "In this tutorial, we've built a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Haystack with OpenAI models and Couchbase Capella's Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes. Using the BBC News dataset, we demonstrated how modern vector indexes make it possible to answer up-to-date questions that extend beyond an LLM's original training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of our RAG system include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Couchbase Capella Hyperscale & Composite Vector Indexes** for high-performance storage and retrieval of document embeddings\n",
    "2. **Haystack** as the framework for building modular RAG pipelines with flexible component connections\n",
    "3. **OpenAI Services** for generating embeddings (`text-embedding-3-large`) and LLM responses (`gpt-4o`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach grounds LLM responses in specific, current information from our knowledge base while taking advantage of Couchbase's advanced vector index options for performance and scale. Haystack's modular pipeline model keeps the solution extensible as you layer in additional data sources or services.\n"
