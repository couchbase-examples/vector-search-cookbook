    "# CrewAI with Couchbase Short-Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a custom storage backend for CrewAI's memory system using Couchbase and vector search. Here's a breakdown of each section:\n",
    "\n",
    "How to run this tutorial\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) that you can run \n",
    "interactively. You can access the original notebook here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either:\n",
    "- Download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
    "- Run it on your system by setting up the Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up)\n",
    "   - To get started with [Couchbase Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com), create an account and use it to deploy \n",
    "     a forever free tier operational cluster\n",
    "   - This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn \n",
    "     about Capella with no time constraint\n",
    "   - To learn more, please follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "   When running Couchbase using Capella, the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) \n",
    "     used in the application\n",
    "   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)"

    "# Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory in AI agents is a crucial capability that allows them to retain and utilize information across interactions, making them more effective and contextually aware. Without memory, agents would be limited to processing only the immediate input, lacking the ability to build upon past experiences or maintain continuity in conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This section on memory types and functionality is adapted from the CrewAI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term Memory\n",
    "- Retains recent interactions and context\n",
    "- Typically spans the current conversation or session  \n",
    "- Helps maintain coherence within a single interaction flow\n",
    "- In CrewAI, this is what we're implementing with the Couchbase storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term Memory\n",
    "- Stores persistent knowledge across multiple sessions\n",
    "- Enables agents to recall past interactions even after long periods\n",
    "- Helps build cumulative knowledge about users, preferences, and past decisions\n",
    "- While this implementation is labeled as \"short-term memory\", the Couchbase storage backend can be effectively used for long-term memory as well, thanks to Couchbase's persistent storage capabilities and enterprise-grade durability features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Memory Works in Agents\n",
    "Memory in AI agents typically involves:\n",
    "- Storage: Information is encoded and stored in a database (like Couchbase, ChromaDB, or other vector stores)\n",
    "- Retrieval: Relevant memories are fetched based on semantic similarity to current context\n",
    "- Integration: Retrieved memories are incorporated into the agent's reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CrewAI example, the CouchbaseStorage class implements:\n",
    "- save(): Stores new memories with metadata\n",
    "- search(): Retrieves relevant memories based on semantic similarity\n",
    "- reset(): Clears stored memories when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "- Contextual Understanding: Agents can refer to previous parts of a conversation\n",
    "- Personalization: Remembering user preferences and past interactions\n",
    "- Learning and Adaptation: Building knowledge over time to improve responses\n",
    "- Task Continuity: Resuming complex tasks across multiple interactions\n",
    "- Collaboration: In multi-agent systems like CrewAI, memory enables agents to build on each other's work\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory in CrewAI Specifically\n",
    "In CrewAI, memory serves several important functions:\n",
    "- Agent Specialization: Each agent can maintain its own memory relevant to its expertise\n",
    "- Knowledge Transfer: Agents can share insights through memory when collaborating on tasks\n",
    "- Process Continuity: In sequential processes, later agents can access the work of earlier agents\n",
    "- Contextual Awareness: Agents can reference previous findings when making decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector-based approach (using embeddings) is particularly powerful because it allows for semantic search - finding memories that are conceptually related to the current context, not just exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing custom storage like Couchbase, you gain additional benefits like persistence, scalability, and the ability to leverage enterprise-grade database features for your agent memory systems."

    "## Conclusion: Benefits of Couchbase for AI Memory Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated in this tutorial, Couchbase offers several advantages for implementing AI agent memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Native Vector Search**: Couchbase provides built-in support for vector embeddings and similarity search, making it ideal for semantic retrieval of agent memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance**: The distributed architecture of Couchbase ensures fast retrieval of relevant memories for real-time agent interactions, even as your data scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: As an enterprise-ready solution, Couchbase can grow with your AI application needs, from development to production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unified Platform**: Store both vector embeddings and structured data in the same database, eliminating the need for multiple specialized systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Flexible Querying**: Combine vector similarity search with traditional queries and filters to retrieve precisely the memories your agents need.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Enterprise Features**: Benefit from Couchbase's security, high availability, and disaster recovery capabilities for production AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Cloud-Native**: With Couchbase Capella, you can deploy your vector store in the cloud with minimal operational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation we've created demonstrates how to:\n",
    "- Connect CrewAI's memory system to Couchbase\n",
    "- Store and retrieve agent memories using vector similarity\n",
    "- Maintain context across multi-agent workflows\n",
    "- Filter memories based on metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Couchbase as your vector store for CrewAI agents, you benefit from a production-ready\n",
    "database with comprehensive vector search capabilities, suitable for both development and\n",
    "enterprise deployment."
