    "\n",
    "You can either:\n",

    "   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) \n",
    "     used in the application\n",
    "   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)"

    "# Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory in AI agents is a crucial capability that allows them to retain and utilize information across interactions, making them more effective and contextually aware. Without memory, agents would be limited to processing only the immediate input, lacking the ability to build upon past experiences or maintain continuity in conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This section on memory types and functionality is adapted from the CrewAI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term Memory\n",
    "- Retains recent interactions and context\n",
    "- Typically spans the current conversation or session  \n",
    "- Helps maintain coherence within a single interaction flow\n",
    "- In CrewAI, this is what we're implementing with the Couchbase storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term Memory\n",
    "- Stores persistent knowledge across multiple sessions\n",
    "- Enables agents to recall past interactions even after long periods\n",
    "- Helps build cumulative knowledge about users, preferences, and past decisions\n",
    "- While this implementation is labeled as \"short-term memory\", the Couchbase storage backend can be effectively used for long-term memory as well, thanks to Couchbase's persistent storage capabilities and enterprise-grade durability features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Memory Works in Agents\n",
    "Memory in AI agents typically involves:\n",
    "- Storage: Information is encoded and stored in a database (like Couchbase, ChromaDB, or other vector stores)\n",
    "- Retrieval: Relevant memories are fetched based on semantic similarity to current context\n",
    "- Integration: Retrieved memories are incorporated into the agent's reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CrewAI example, the CouchbaseStorage class implements:\n",
    "- save(): Stores new memories with metadata\n",
    "- search(): Retrieves relevant memories based on semantic similarity\n",
    "- reset(): Clears stored memories when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "- Contextual Understanding: Agents can refer to previous parts of a conversation\n",
    "- Personalization: Remembering user preferences and past interactions\n",
    "- Learning and Adaptation: Building knowledge over time to improve responses\n",
    "- Task Continuity: Resuming complex tasks across multiple interactions\n",
    "- Collaboration: In multi-agent systems like CrewAI, memory enables agents to build on each other's work\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory in CrewAI Specifically\n",
    "In CrewAI, memory serves several important functions:\n",
    "- Agent Specialization: Each agent can maintain its own memory relevant to its expertise\n",
    "- Knowledge Transfer: Agents can share insights through memory when collaborating on tasks\n",
    "- Process Continuity: In sequential processes, later agents can access the work of earlier agents\n",
    "- Contextual Awareness: Agents can reference previous findings when making decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector-based approach (using embeddings) is particularly powerful because it allows for semantic search - finding memories that are conceptually related to the current context, not just exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing custom storage like Couchbase, you gain additional benefits like persistence, scalability, and the ability to leverage enterprise-grade database features for your agent memory systems."

      "Historically, Guardiola's sides have been renowned for their possession-based play and tactical flexibility. This season, City continues to exemplify these principles, maintaining an impressive average possession of over 60% in recent matches. This ability to control the game’s tempo has been pivotal in their recent string of victories and is indicative of their strategic dominance on the pitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key to this success are the stellar performances from City’s roster of world-class talent. Kevin De Bruyne, with his unparalleled vision and precision passing, has been instrumental in orchestrating play and dismantling defenses. Erling Haaland, a new addition to the squad, has bolstered City’s attacking threat with his prolific goal-scoring ability, adding a new dimension to their already potent offensive setup. Meanwhile, Phil Foden’s versatility and creativity on the field provide Guardiola with a plethora of tactical options, making him an invaluable asset.\n",
