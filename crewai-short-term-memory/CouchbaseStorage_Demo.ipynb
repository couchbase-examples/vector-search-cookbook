    "# CrewAI with Couchbase Short-Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a custom storage backend for CrewAI's memory system using Couchbase and vector search. Here's a breakdown of each section:\n",
    "\n",
    "How to run this tutorial\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) that you can run \n",
    "interactively. You can access the original notebook here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either:\n",
    "- Download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
    "- Run it on your system by setting up the Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up)\n",
    "   - To get started with [Couchbase Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com), create an account and use it to deploy \n",
    "     a forever free tier operational cluster\n",
    "   - This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn \n",
    "     about Capella with no time constraint\n",
    "   - To learn more, please follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "   When running Couchbase using Capella, the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) \n",
    "     used in the application\n",
    "   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)"

    "# Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory in AI agents is a crucial capability that allows them to retain and utilize information across interactions, making them more effective and contextually aware. Without memory, agents would be limited to processing only the immediate input, lacking the ability to build upon past experiences or maintain continuity in conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This section on memory types and functionality is adapted from the CrewAI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-term Memory\n",
    "- Retains recent interactions and context\n",
    "- Typically spans the current conversation or session  \n",
    "- Helps maintain coherence within a single interaction flow\n",
    "- In CrewAI, this is what we're implementing with the Couchbase storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long-term Memory\n",
    "- Stores persistent knowledge across multiple sessions\n",
    "- Enables agents to recall past interactions even after long periods\n",
    "- Helps build cumulative knowledge about users, preferences, and past decisions\n",
    "- While this implementation is labeled as \"short-term memory\", the Couchbase storage backend can be effectively used for long-term memory as well, thanks to Couchbase's persistent storage capabilities and enterprise-grade durability features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Memory Works in Agents\n",
    "Memory in AI agents typically involves:\n",
    "- Storage: Information is encoded and stored in a database (like Couchbase, ChromaDB, or other vector stores)\n",
    "- Retrieval: Relevant memories are fetched based on semantic similarity to current context\n",
    "- Integration: Retrieved memories are incorporated into the agent's reasoning process\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CrewAI example, the CouchbaseStorage class implements:\n",
    "- save(): Stores new memories with metadata\n",
    "- search(): Retrieves relevant memories based on semantic similarity\n",
    "- reset(): Clears stored memories when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "- Contextual Understanding: Agents can refer to previous parts of a conversation\n",
    "- Personalization: Remembering user preferences and past interactions\n",
    "- Learning and Adaptation: Building knowledge over time to improve responses\n",
    "- Task Continuity: Resuming complex tasks across multiple interactions\n",
    "- Collaboration: In multi-agent systems like CrewAI, memory enables agents to build on each other's work\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory in CrewAI Specifically\n",
    "In CrewAI, memory serves several important functions:\n",
    "- Agent Specialization: Each agent can maintain its own memory relevant to its expertise\n",
    "- Knowledge Transfer: Agents can share insights through memory when collaborating on tasks\n",
    "- Process Continuity: In sequential processes, later agents can access the work of earlier agents\n",
    "- Contextual Awareness: Agents can reference previous findings when making decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector-based approach (using embeddings) is particularly powerful because it allows for semantic search - finding memories that are conceptually related to the current context, not just exact keyword matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing custom storage like Couchbase, you gain additional benefits like persistence, scalability, and the ability to leverage enterprise-grade database features for your agent memory systems."

Guardiola's satisfaction, expressed through his remarks, \"The team is playing well, we are in a good moment.

      "\n",
      "1. **Offensive and Defensive Performance:**\n",
      "   - Offensively, Manchester City has exhibited dominance, characterized by fluid attacking movements and versatility in their forward play. The team's hallmark in recent matches has been their ability to maintain possession and create goal-scoring opportunities. Players like Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne have been instrumental in leading City's attacking prowess, showcasing their ability to break down defenses with precision and creativity.\n",
      "   - On the defensive front, Manchester City has displayed resilience and organization. The backline, led by Ruben Dias and supported by players such as Kyle Walker, has been effective in limiting opposition chances. This defensive strength is further augmented by City's ability to press high, recover the ball quickly, and transition swiftly into attack, minimizing threats from opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tactical Approaches:**\n",
      "   - Guardiola's tactical acumen plays a pivotal role in City's performance. His ability to adapt strategies based on the opposition and game situation ensures the team remains competitive. This adaptability is evident in his deployment of a false nine or utilization of wide players to stretch defenses, creating space for midfielders to exploit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Player Performance Metrics:**\n",
      "   - Key players, including Phil Foden, Rodri, and Jack Grealish, have consistently performed at high levels, contributing significantly both offensively and defensively.

      "\n",
      "5. **Areas for Improvement:**\n",
      "   - Despite the positive form, some areas need improvement. Manchester City has occasionally been susceptible to counter-attacks, and addressing this vulnerability could further solidify their defensive stability. Moreover, increasing the conversion rate of created chances would enhance their goal-scoring efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Comparative Analysis:**\n",
      "   - In comparison to other top Premier League teams, Manchester City's performance remains robust. Their ability to maintain high standards consistently positions them as strong title contenders, distinguishing them from their competitors.\n",
      "\n",
