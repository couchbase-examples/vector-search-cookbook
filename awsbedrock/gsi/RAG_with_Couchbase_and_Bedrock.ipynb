    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) as both the embedding and language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using GSI( Global Secondary Index) from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the FTS index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-aws-bedrock-couchbase-rag-with-fts/)"

    "A vector store is where we'll keep our embeddings. The query vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, GSI converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables us to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used.\n",

    "The vector store requires a distance metric to determine how similarity between vectors is calculated. This is crucial for accurate semantic search results as different distance metrics can yield different similarity rankings. Some of the supported Distance strategies are dot, l2, euclidean, cosine, l2_squared, euclidean_squared. In our implementation we will use cosine which is particularly effective for text embeddings."

    "# Perform Semantic Search\n",
    "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the `similarity_search_with_score` method of the `CouchbaseQueryVectorStore`. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and the distance that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

      "\n",
      "A tearful Luke Littler hit a tournament record 140.91 set average as he started his bid for the PDC World Championship title with a dramatic 3-1 win over Ryan Meikle. The 17-year-old made headlines around the world when he reached the tournament final in January, where he lost to Luke Humphries. Starting this campaign on Saturday, Littler was millimetres away from a nine-darter when he missed double 12 as he blew Meikle away in the fourth and final set of the second-round match. Littler was overcome with emotion at the end, cutting short his on-stage interview. \"It was probably the toughest game I've ever played. I had to fight until the end,\" he said later in a news conference. \"As soon as the question came on stage and then boom, the tears came. It was just a bit too much to speak on stage. \"It is the worst game I have played. I have never felt anything like that tonight.\" Admitting to nerves during the match, he told Sky Sports: \"Yes, probably the biggest time it's hit me. Coming into it I was fine, but as soon as [referee] George Noble said 'game on', I couldn't throw them.\" Littler started slowly against Meikle, who had two darts for the opening set, but he took the lead by twice hitting double 20. Meikle did not look overawed against his fellow Englishman and levelled, but Littler won the third set and exploded into life in the fourth. The tournament favourite hit four maximum 180s as he clinched three straight legs in 11, 10 and 11 darts for a record set average, and 100.85 overall. Meanwhile, two seeds crashed out on Saturday night – five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld lost to Welshman Nick Kenny, while England's Ryan Joyce beat Danny Noppert. Australian Damon Heta was another to narrowly miss out on a nine-darter, just failing on double 12 when throwing for the match in a 3-1 win over Connor Scutt. Ninth seed Heta hit four 100-plus checkouts to come from a set down against Scutt in a match in which both men averaged more than 97.\n",

      "Littler was hugged by his parents after victory over Meikle\n",
      "\n",
      "Littler returned to Alexandra Palace to a boisterous reception from more than 3,000 spectators and delivered an astonishing display in the fourth set. He was on for a nine-darter after his opening two throws in both of the first two legs and completed the set in 32 darts - the minimum possible is 27. The teenager will next play after Christmas against European Championship winner Ritchie Edhouse, the 29th seed, or Ian White, and is seeded to meet Humphries in the semi-finals. Having entered last year's event ranked 164th, Littler is up to fourth in the world and will go to number two if he reaches the final again this time. He has won 10 titles in his debut professional year, including the Premier League and Grand Slam of Darts. After reaching the World Championship final as a debutant aged just 16, Littler's life has been transformed and interest in darts has rocketed. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. This Christmas, more than 100,000 children are expected to be opening Littler-branded magnetic dartboards as presents. His impact has helped double the number of junior academies and has prompted plans to expand the World Championship. Littler was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year on Tuesday and was runner-up to athlete Keely Hodgkinson for the main award.\n",

Kenny, 32, will face Humphries in round three after defeating the Dutchman, who won the BDO world title four times and the PDC crown in 2007. Van Barneveld, ranked 32nd, became the sixth seed to exit in the second round. His compatriot Noppert, the 13th seed, was stunned 3-1 by Joyce, who will face Ryan Searle or Matt Campbell next, with the winner of that tie potentially meeting Littler in the last 16. Elsewhere, 15th seed Chris Dobey booked his place in the third round with a 3-1 win over Alexander Merkx. Englishman Dobey concluded an afternoon session which started with a trio of 3-0 scorelines. Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan beat Lok Yin Lee to set up a meeting with three-time champion Michael van Gerwen after Christmas. In the final two first-round matches of the 2025 competition, Wales' Rhys Griffin beat Karel Sedlacek of the Czech Republic before Asia number one Alexis Toylo cruised past Richard Veenstra.\n",

      "One year ago, he was barely a household name in his own home. Now he is a sporting phenomenon. After emerging from obscurity aged 16 to reach the World Championship final, the life of Luke Littler and the sport he loves has been transformed. Viewing figures, ticket sales and social media interest have rocketed. Darts has hit the bullseye.

      "\n",
      "Just months after taking his GCSE exams and ranked 164th in the world, Littler beat former champions Raymond van Barneveld and Rob Cross en route to the PDC World Championship final in January, before his run ended with a 7-4 loss to Luke Humphries. With his nickname 'The Nuke' on his purple and yellow shirt and the Alexandra Palace crowd belting out his walk-on song, Pitbull's tune Greenlight, he became an instant hit. Electric on the stage, calm off it. The down-to-earth teenager celebrated with a kebab and computer games. \"We've been watching his progress since he was about seven. He was on our radar, but we never anticipated what would happen. The next thing we know 'Littlermania' is spreading everywhere,\" PDC president Barry Hearn told BBC Sport. A peak TV audience of 3.7 million people watched the final - easily Sky's biggest figure for a non-football sporting event. The teenager from Warrington in Cheshire was too young to legally drive or drink alcohol, but earned £200,000 for finishing second - part of £1m prize money in his first year as a professional - and an invitation to the elite Premier League competition. He turned 17 later in January but was he too young for the demanding event over 17 Thursday nights in 17 locations? He ended up winning the whole thing, and hit a nine-dart finish against Humphries in the final. From Bahrain to Wolverhampton, Littler claimed 10 titles in 2024 and is now eyeing the World Championship.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he progressed at the Ally Pally, the Manchester United fan was sent a good luck message by the club's former midfielder and ex-England captain David Beckham. In 12 months, Littler's Instagram followers have risen from 4,000 to 1.3m. Commercial backers include a clothing range, cereal firm and train company and he will appear in a reboot of the TV darts show Bullseye. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. On the back of his success, Littler darts, boards, cabinets, shirts are being snapped up in big numbers. \"This Christmas the junior magnetic dartboard is selling out, we're talking over 100,000. They're 20 quid and a great introduction for young children,\" said Garry Plummer, the boss of sponsors Target Darts, who first signed a deal with Littler's family when he was aged 12. \"All the toy shops want it, they all want him - 17, clean, doesn't drink, wonderful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Littler beat Luke Humphries to win the Premier League title in May\n",

      "The number of academies for children under the age of 16 has doubled in the last year, says Junior Darts Corporation chairman Steve Brown. There are 115 dedicated groups offering youngsters equipment, tournaments and a place to develop, with bases including Australia, Bulgaria, Greece, Norway, USA and Mongolia. \"We've seen so many inquiries from around the world, it's been such a boom. It took us 14 years to get 1,600 members and within 12 months we have over 3,000, and waiting lists,\" said Brown. \"When I played darts as a child, I was quite embarrassed to tell my friends what my hobby was. All these kids playing darts now are pretty popular at school. It's a bit rock 'n roll and recognised as a cool thing to do.\" Plans are being hatched to extend the World Championship by four days and increase the number of players from 96 to 128. That will boost the number of tickets available by 25,000 to 115,000 but Hearn reckons he could sell three times as many. He says Saudi Arabia wants to host a tournament, which is likely to happen if no-alcohol regulations are relaxed. \"They will change their rules in the next 12 months probably for certain areas having alcohol, and we'll take darts there and have a party in Saudi,\" he said. \"When I got involved in darts, the total prize money was something like £300,000 for the year. This year it will go to £20m. I expect in five years' time, we'll be playing for £40m.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Former electrician Cross charged to the 2018 world title in his first full season, while Adrian Lewis and Michael van Gerwen were multiple victors in their 20s and 16-time champion Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor is widely considered the greatest of all time. Littler is currently fourth in the world rankings, although that is based on a two-year Order of Merit. There have been suggestions from others the spotlight on the teenager means world number one Humphries, 29, has been denied the coverage he deserves, but no darts player has made a mark at such a young age as Littler. \"Luke Humphries is another fabulous player who is going to be around for years. Sport is a very brutal world. It is about winning and claiming the high ground. There will be envy around,\" Hearn said. \"Luke Littler is the next Tiger Woods for darts so they better get used to it, and the only way to compete is to get better.\" World number 38 Martin Lukeman was awestruck as he described facing a peak Littler after being crushed 16-3 in the Grand Slam final, with the teenager winning 15 consecutive legs. \"I can't compete with that, it was like Godly. He was relentless, he is so good it's ridiculous,\" he said. Lukeman can still see the benefits he brings, adding: \"What he's done for the sport is brilliant. If it wasn't for him, our wages wouldn't be going up. There's more sponsors, more money coming in, all good.\" Hearn feels future competition may come from players even younger than Littler. \"I watched a 10-year-old a few months ago who averaged 104.89 and checked out a 4-3 win with a 136 finish. They smell the money, the fame and put the hard work in,\" he said. How much better Littler can get is guesswork, although Plummer believes he wants to reach new heights. \"He never says 'how good was I?' But I think he wants to break records and beat Phil Taylor's 16 World Championships and 16 World Matchplay titles,\" he said. \"He's young enough to do it.\" A version of this article was originally published on 29 November.\n",

The 17-year-old has enjoyed a breakthrough year after finishing runner-up at the 2024 PDC World Darts Championship in January. The Englishman, who has won 10 senior titles on the Professional Darts Corporation tour this year, is the first darts player to claim the award. \"It shows how well I have done this year, not only for myself, but I have changed the sport of darts,\" Littler told BBC One. \"I know the amount of academies that have been brought up in different locations, tickets selling out at Ally Pally in hours and the Premier League selling out - it just shows how much I have changed it.\"\n",

Littler became a household name at the start of 2024 by reaching the World Championship final aged just 16 years and 347 days. That achievement was just the start of a trophy-laden year, with Littler winning the Premier League Darts, Grand Slam and World Series of Darts Finals among his haul of titles. Littler has gone from 164th to fourth in the world rankings and earned more than £1m in prize money in 2024.

The 17-year-old star was an unknown when he came to prominence as the youngest player to reach the World Darts Championship final in January. He has subsequently risen to fourth in the world rankings and his fame has led him to lie behind only Catherine, Princess of Wales, and US president elect Donald Trump as Google's most searched for person in the UK in 2024. He has also taken the top slot as the most searched for athlete on the search engine, which he said was \"a proud moment\" in what had been \"an amazing year\".\n",

      "A peak TV audience of 3.7m watched the then-16-year-old's appearance in the final. He lost by seven sets to four to world number one Luke Humphries, but earned £200,000 as the runner-up. He beat Michael van Gerwen later in the same month to win the Bahrain Darts Masters and secure his first Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) senior title. The event also saw he become the youngest person to make a nine-dart finish on live television, which is considered one of the sport's highest achievements and sees a player score the required 501 in the lowest number of darts possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luke Littler said the award was a \"huge honour\"\n",

      "Former champion Rob Cross became the latest high-profile casualty as a record-breaking 14th seed exited the PDC World Darts Championship in the second round. The number five seed was beaten 3-1 by close friend Scott Williams, who will face Germany's Ricardo Pietreczko in round three. Cross, who won the event on his debut in 2018, took the opening set but failed to reach anywhere near his best as he suffered his third second-round exit. He was joined by number six seed David Chisnall, who was beaten 3-2 in a sudden-death leg by Ricky Evans, who came into the tournament 46th in the PDC's Order of Merit. The 2021 semi-finalist won the opening set, but then found himself 2-1 down to an inspired Evans, who was cheered on relentlessly by the Alexandra Palace crowd. He forced the game into a deciding set and faced match dart but Evans missed bullseye by the width of the wire. Chisnall then missed his own match dart on double tops, before he made a miscalculation when attempting to checkout 139 at 5-4 down. No real harm was done with a sudden-death leg forced but he was unable to hold off Evans, who reaches the third round for the third time in the last five years. \"It's not even what it is, again I've played a world-class darts player. I've played quite well and won,\" Evans told Sky Sports. \"Look at this [the crowd], wow. I don't understand it, why are they cheering me on? \"I don't get this reception in my household. Thank you very much. You've made a very fat guy very happy.\" Evans will face unseeded Welshman Robert Owen when the third round starts after the three-day Christmas break.\n",

      "World youth champion Gian van Veen had become the 12th seed to be knocked out when he lost 3-1 to Pietreczko. The 28th seed lost the opening set, having missed nine darts at double, but levelled. However, the Dutchman was unable to match Pietreczko, who closed out a comfortable win with a checkout percentage of 55.6%. Pietreczko said: \"I am over the moon to win. It is very important for me to be in the third round after Christmas. I love the big stage.\" The 26th seed trailed 1-0 and 2-1, and both players went on to miss match darts, before Gurney won the final set 3-1 on legs.\n",

He was a leg away from defeat twice to his Northern Irish opponent, but came from behind to win the final set 6-5 in a sudden-death leg to win 3-2. Clayton, who will play Gurney in round three, lost the opening set of the match, but fought back to lead 2-1, before being pegged back again by 51-year-old Mansell, who then missed match darts on double tops in the deciding set. \"I was very emotional. I've got to be honest, that meant a lot,\" said Clayton, who is in the favourable half of the draw following shock second-round exits for former world champions Michael Smith and Gary Anderson. \"I had chances before and Mickey definitely had chances before. It wasn't great to play in, not the best - I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. \"There is a lot of weight off my shoulders after that. I know there is another gear or two in the bank, but I'll be honest that meant a lot to me, it is a tester and will try and make me believe again.\" Clayton was 2-0 down in the fifth set after consecutive 136 and 154 checkouts from Mansell, but won three legs on the trot in 15, 12 and 10 darts to wrestle a 3-2 lead. He missed three darts for the match, before his unseeded opponent held and broke Clayton's throw to lead 4-3. Mansell missed a match dart at double 20, before Clayton won on double five after two missed checkouts. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland's Josh Rock booked his place in the third round against England's Chris Dobey with a 3-0 win over Wales' Rhys Griffin. Martin Lukeman, runner-up to Luke Littler at the Grand Slam of Darts last month, is out after a 3-1 loss to number 21 seed Andrew Gilding.

The three-time world champion has had a tough year by his standards, having fallen behind Luke Littler and Luke Humphries, so a relatively stress-free opening match at Alexandra Palace was just what was needed. Hurrell, 40, offered some resistance early on when taking the opening leg of the match, but he would win just two more as Van Gerwen proved far too strong. The third-seeded Dutchman averaged 94.85, took out two three-figure checkouts and hit 50% of his doubles - with six of his nine misses coming in one scrappy leg. Van Gerwen, 35, will now face either Brendan Dolan or Lok Yin Lee in the third round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I played OK,\" Van Gerwen told Sky Sports after his match. \"Of course, I was a bit nervous. Like everyone knows it's been a tough year for me. \"Overall, it was a good performance. I was confident. I won the game, that's the main thing.\" Also on Friday night, Germany's Florian Hempel showed why he loves playing on the Alexandra Palace stage with a thrilling 3-1 victory in a high-quality contest against Jeffrey de Zwaan. Both men hit seven 180s in a match played at a fast and furious pace, but 34-year-old Hempel's superior doubles gave him a fourth straight first-round victory in the competition. Hempel moves on to a tie with 26th seed Daryl Gurney but it was a damaging loss for De Zwaan, 28, who came through a late qualifier in November and needed a good run here to keep his PDC tour card for next season. Mickey Mansell earned a second-round date with world number seven Jonny Clayton after a scrappy 3-1 win over Japan's Tomoya Goto, while Dylan Slevin came through an all-Irish tie against William O'Connor to progress to a meeting with Dimitri van den Bergh.\n",

Tournament debutant Gotthardt missed three darts at double eight to win the second set, allowing Bunting to take out double 10 to level the match before powering away to victory by winning the third and fourth sets without losing a leg. Victory for \"The Bullet\" sets up a last 32 meeting with the winner of Dirk van Duijvenbode's meeting with Madars Razma after Christmas. Should Bunting progress further, he is seeded to face world number one and defending world champion Luke Humphries in the quarter-finals on New Year's Day. Elsewhere in Friday afternoon's session, the Dutch duo of Alexander Merkx and Wessel Nijman advanced to the second round with wins over Stephen Burton and Cameron Carolissen respectively.

The Dutchman became the first player to seal a perfect leg in the tournament since Michael Smith did so on the way to beating Michael van Gerwen in the 2023 final. Kist, the 2012 BDO world champion at Lakeside, collects £60,000 for the feat, with the same amount being awarded by sponsors to a charity and to one spectator inside Alexandra Palace in London. The 38-year-old's brilliant finish sealed the opening set, but his Latvian opponent bounced back to win 3-1. Darts is one of the few sports that can measure perfection; snooker has the 147 maximum break, golf has the hole-in-one, darts has the nine-dart finish. Kist scored two maximum 180s to leave a 141 checkout which he completed with a double 12, to the delight of more than 3,000 spectators. The English 12th seed, who has been troubled by wrist and back injuries, could next play Andrew Gilding in the third round - which begins on 27 December - should Gilding beat the winner of Martin Lukeman's match against qualifier Nitin Kumar. Aspinall faces a tough task to reach the last four again, with 2018 champion Rob Cross and 2024 runner-up Luke Littler both in his side of the draw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kist - who was knocked out of last year's tournament by teenager Littler - will still earn a bigger cheque than he would have got for a routine run to the quarter-finals. His nine-darter was the 15th in the history of the championship and first since the greatest leg in darts history when Smith struck, moments after Van Gerwen just missed his attempt. Darts fan Kris, a railway worker from Sutton in south London, was the random spectator picked out to receive £60,000, with Prostate Cancer UK getting the same sum from tournament sponsors Paddy Power. \"I'm speechless to be honest. I didn't expect it to happen to me,\" Kris said. \"This was a birthday present so it makes it even better. My grandad got me tickets. It was just a normal day - I came here after work.\" Kist said: \"Hitting the double 12 felt amazing. It was a lovely moment for everyone and I hope Kris enjoys the money. Maybe I will go on vacation next month.\" Earlier, Jim Williams was favourite against Paolo Nebrida but lost 3-2 in an epic lasting more than an hour. The Filipino took a surprise 2-1 lead and Williams only went ahead for the first time in the opening leg of the deciding set. The Welshman looked on course for victory but missed five match darts. UK Open semi-finalist Ricky Evans set up a second-round match against Dave Chisnall, checking out on 109 to edge past Gordon Mathers 3-2.\n",

    "Couchbase offers three types of vector indexes, but for GSI-based vector search we focus on two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperscale Vector Indexes (BHIVE)\n",
    "- Best for pure vector searches - content discovery, recommendations, semantic search\n",
    "- High performance with low memory footprint - designed to scale to billions of vectors\n",
    "- Optimized for concurrent operations - supports simultaneous searches and inserts\n",
    "- Use when: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering\n",
    "- Ideal for: Large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, content discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite Vector Indexes \n",
    "- Best for filtered vector searches - combines vector search with scalar value filtering\n",
    "- Efficient pre-filtering - scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope\n",
    "- Use when: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data\n",
    "- Ideal for: Compliance-based filtering, user-specific searches, time-bounded queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the Right Index Type\n",
    "- Start with Hyperscale Vector Index for pure vector searches and large datasets\n",
    "- Use Composite Vector Index when scalar filters significantly reduce your search space\n",
    "- Consider your dataset size: Hyperscale scales to billions, Composite works well for tens of millions to billions\n",

    "- More centroids = faster search, slower training  \n",
    "- Fewer centroids = slower search, faster training\n",
    "- If omitted (like IVF,SQ8), Couchbase auto-selects based on dataset size\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization Options:\n",
    "- SQ (Scalar Quantization): SQ4, SQ6, SQ8 (4, 6, or 8 bits per dimension)\n",
    "- PQ (Product Quantization): PQ<subquantizers>x<bits> (e.g., PQ32x8)\n",
    "- Higher values = better accuracy, larger index size\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Examples:\n",
    "- IVF,SQ8 - Auto centroids, 8-bit scalar quantization (good default)\n",
    "- IVF1000,SQ6 - 1000 centroids, 6-bit scalar quantization  \n",
    "- IVF,PQ32x8 - Auto centroids, 32 subquantizers with 8 bits\n",

      "A tearful Luke Littler hit a tournament record 140.91 set average as he started his bid for the PDC World Championship title with a dramatic 3-1 win over Ryan Meikle. The 17-year-old made headlines around the world when he reached the tournament final in January, where he lost to Luke Humphries. Starting this campaign on Saturday, Littler was millimetres away from a nine-darter when he missed double 12 as he blew Meikle away in the fourth and final set of the second-round match. Littler was overcome with emotion at the end, cutting short his on-stage interview. \"It was probably the toughest game I've ever played. I had to fight until the end,\" he said later in a news conference. \"As soon as the question came on stage and then boom, the tears came. It was just a bit too much to speak on stage. \"It is the worst game I have played. I have never felt anything like that tonight.\" Admitting to nerves during the match, he told Sky Sports: \"Yes, probably the biggest time it's hit me. Coming into it I was fine, but as soon as [referee] George Noble said 'game on', I couldn't throw them.\" Littler started slowly against Meikle, who had two darts for the opening set, but he took the lead by twice hitting double 20. Meikle did not look overawed against his fellow Englishman and levelled, but Littler won the third set and exploded into life in the fourth. The tournament favourite hit four maximum 180s as he clinched three straight legs in 11, 10 and 11 darts for a record set average, and 100.85 overall. Meanwhile, two seeds crashed out on Saturday night – five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld lost to Welshman Nick Kenny, while England's Ryan Joyce beat Danny Noppert. Australian Damon Heta was another to narrowly miss out on a nine-darter, just failing on double 12 when throwing for the match in a 3-1 win over Connor Scutt. Ninth seed Heta hit four 100-plus checkouts to come from a set down against Scutt in a match in which both men averaged more than 97.\n",

      "Littler returned to Alexandra Palace to a boisterous reception from more than 3,000 spectators and delivered an astonishing display in the fourth set. He was on for a nine-darter after his opening two throws in both of the first two legs and completed the set in 32 darts - the minimum possible is 27. The teenager will next play after Christmas against European Championship winner Ritchie Edhouse, the 29th seed, or Ian White, and is seeded to meet Humphries in the semi-finals. Having entered last year's event ranked 164th, Littler is up to fourth in the world and will go to number two if he reaches the final again this time. He has won 10 titles in his debut professional year, including the Premier League and Grand Slam of Darts. After reaching the World Championship final as a debutant aged just 16, Littler's life has been transformed and interest in darts has rocketed. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. This Christmas, more than 100,000 children are expected to be opening Littler-branded magnetic dartboards as presents. His impact has helped double the number of junior academies and has prompted plans to expand the World Championship. Littler was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year on Tuesday and was runner-up to athlete Keely Hodgkinson for the main award.\n",

Van Barneveld, ranked 32nd, became the sixth seed to exit in the second round. His compatriot Noppert, the 13th seed, was stunned 3-1 by Joyce, who will face Ryan Searle or Matt Campbell next, with the winner of that tie potentially meeting Littler in the last 16. Elsewhere, 15th seed Chris Dobey booked his place in the third round with a 3-1 win over Alexander Merkx. Englishman Dobey concluded an afternoon session which started with a trio of 3-0 scorelines.

Here we assess Littler's impact after a remarkable rise which saw him named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year and runner-up in the main award to athlete Keely Hodgkinson.\n",
      "\n",
      "One year ago, he was barely a household name in his own home. Now he is a sporting phenomenon. After emerging from obscurity aged 16 to reach the World Championship final, the life of Luke Littler and the sport he loves has been transformed. Viewing figures, ticket sales and social media interest have rocketed. Darts has hit the bullseye. This Christmas more than 100,000 children are expected to be opening Littler-branded magnetic dartboards as presents. His impact has helped double the number of junior academies, prompted plans to expand the World Championship and generated interest in darts from Saudi Arabian backers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just months after taking his GCSE exams and ranked 164th in the world, Littler beat former champions Raymond van Barneveld and Rob Cross en route to the PDC World Championship final in January, before his run ended with a 7-4 loss to Luke Humphries. With his nickname 'The Nuke' on his purple and yellow shirt and the Alexandra Palace crowd belting out his walk-on song, Pitbull's tune Greenlight, he became an instant hit. Electric on the stage, calm off it. The down-to-earth teenager celebrated with a kebab and computer games. \"We've been watching his progress since he was about seven. He was on our radar, but we never anticipated what would happen. The next thing we know 'Littlermania' is spreading everywhere,\" PDC president Barry Hearn told BBC Sport. A peak TV audience of 3.7 million people watched the final - easily Sky's biggest figure for a non-football sporting event. The teenager from Warrington in Cheshire was too young to legally drive or drink alcohol, but earned £200,000 for finishing second - part of £1m prize money in his first year as a professional - and an invitation to the elite Premier League competition. He turned 17 later in January but was he too young for the demanding event over 17 Thursday nights in 17 locations? He ended up winning the whole thing, and hit a nine-dart finish against Humphries in the final. From Bahrain to Wolverhampton, Littler claimed 10 titles in 2024 and is now eyeing the World Championship.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he progressed at the Ally Pally, the Manchester United fan was sent a good luck message by the club's former midfielder and ex-England captain David Beckham. In 12 months, Littler's Instagram followers have risen from 4,000 to 1.3m. Commercial backers include a clothing range, cereal firm and train company and he will appear in a reboot of the TV darts show Bullseye. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. On the back of his success, Littler darts, boards, cabinets, shirts are being snapped up in big numbers. \"This Christmas the junior magnetic dartboard is selling out, we're talking over 100,000. They're 20 quid and a great introduction for young children,\" said Garry Plummer, the boss of sponsors Target Darts, who first signed a deal with Littler's family when he was aged 12. \"All the toy shops want it, they all want him - 17, clean, doesn't drink, wonderful.\"\n",

      "The number of academies for children under the age of 16 has doubled in the last year, says Junior Darts Corporation chairman Steve Brown. There are 115 dedicated groups offering youngsters equipment, tournaments and a place to develop, with bases including Australia, Bulgaria, Greece, Norway, USA and Mongolia. \"We've seen so many inquiries from around the world, it's been such a boom. It took us 14 years to get 1,600 members and within 12 months we have over 3,000, and waiting lists,\" said Brown. \"When I played darts as a child, I was quite embarrassed to tell my friends what my hobby was. All these kids playing darts now are pretty popular at school. It's a bit rock 'n roll and recognised as a cool thing to do.\" Plans are being hatched to extend the World Championship by four days and increase the number of players from 96 to 128. That will boost the number of tickets available by 25,000 to 115,000 but Hearn reckons he could sell three times as many. He says Saudi Arabia wants to host a tournament, which is likely to happen if no-alcohol regulations are relaxed. \"They will change their rules in the next 12 months probably for certain areas having alcohol, and we'll take darts there and have a party in Saudi,\" he said. \"When I got involved in darts, the total prize money was something like £300,000 for the year. This year it will go to £20m. I expect in five years' time, we'll be playing for £40m.\"\n",

      "Former electrician Cross charged to the 2018 world title in his first full season, while Adrian Lewis and Michael van Gerwen were multiple victors in their 20s and 16-time champion Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor is widely considered the greatest of all time. Littler is currently fourth in the world rankings, although that is based on a two-year Order of Merit. There have been suggestions from others the spotlight on the teenager means world number one Humphries, 29, has been denied the coverage he deserves, but no darts player has made a mark at such a young age as Littler. \"Luke Humphries is another fabulous player who is going to be around for years. Sport is a very brutal world. It is about winning and claiming the high ground. There will be envy around,\" Hearn said. \"Luke Littler is the next Tiger Woods for darts so they better get used to it, and the only way to compete is to get better.\" World number 38 Martin Lukeman was awestruck as he described facing a peak Littler after being crushed 16-3 in the Grand Slam final, with the teenager winning 15 consecutive legs. \"I can't compete with that, it was like Godly. He was relentless, he is so good it's ridiculous,\" he said. Lukeman can still see the benefits he brings, adding: \"What he's done for the sport is brilliant. If it wasn't for him, our wages wouldn't be going up. There's more sponsors, more money coming in, all good.\" Hearn feels future competition may come from players even younger than Littler. \"I watched a 10-year-old a few months ago who averaged 104.89 and checked out a 4-3 win with a 136 finish. They smell the money, the fame and put the hard work in,\" he said. How much better Littler can get is guesswork, although Plummer believes he wants to reach new heights. \"He never says 'how good was I?' But I think he wants to break records and beat Phil Taylor's 16 World Championships and 16 World Matchplay titles,\" he said. \"He's young enough to do it.\" A version of this article was originally published on 29 November.\n",

The Englishman, who has won 10 senior titles on the Professional Darts Corporation tour this year, is the first darts player to claim the award. \"It shows how well I have done this year, not only for myself, but I have changed the sport of darts,\" Littler told BBC One. \"I know the amount of academies that have been brought up in different locations, tickets selling out at Ally Pally in hours and the Premier League selling out - it just shows how much I have changed it.\"\n",

Littler became a household name at the start of 2024 by reaching the World Championship final aged just 16 years and 347 days. That achievement was just the start of a trophy-laden year, with Littler winning the Premier League Darts, Grand Slam and World Series of Darts Finals among his haul of titles. Littler has gone from 164th to fourth in the world rankings and earned more than £1m in prize money in 2024.

Scotland's Wright, the 2020 and 2022 winner, has been out of form this year, but overcame Wesley Plaisier 3-1 in the second round at Alexandra Palace in London. \"It was this crowd that got me through, they wanted me to win. I thank you all,\" said Wright. Meikle came from a set down to claim a 3-2 victory in his first-round match against Sherrock, who was the first woman to win matches at the tournament five years ago. The 28-year-old will now play on Saturday against Littler, who was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year and runner-up in the main award to athlete Keely Hodgkinson on Tuesday night. Littler, 17, will be competing on the Ally Pally stage for the first time since his rise to stardom when finishing runner-up in January's world final to Luke Humphries. Earlier on Tuesday, World Grand Prix champion Mike de Decker – the 24th seed - suffered a surprise defeat to Luke Woodhouse in the second round. He is the second seed to exit following 16th seed James Wade's defeat on Monday to Jermaine Wattimena, who meets Wright in round three.

He lost the next but Dutchman Plaisier missed two more set darts in the fourth and Wright seized his opportunity. \"Wesley had his chances but he missed them and I took them,\" he said. \"He's got his tour card and he's going to be a dangerous player next year for all the players playing against him.\" Sherrock, 30, fought back from 2-1 down to force a decider against her English compatriot Meikle. She then narrowly missed the bull to take out 170 in the fourth leg before left-hander Meikle held his nerve to hit double 18 for a 96 finish to seal a hard-fought success. \"I felt under pressure from the start and to come through feels unbelievable,\" said Meikle. \"It's an unbelievable prize to play Luke here on this stage. It's the biggest stage of them all. I'm so happy.\" World number 81 Jeffrey de Graaf, who was born in the Netherlands but now represents Sweden, looked in trouble against Rashad Sweeting before prevailing 3-1.

The number five seed was beaten 3-1 by close friend Scott Williams, who will face Germany's Ricardo Pietreczko in round three. Cross, who won the event on his debut in 2018, took the opening set but failed to reach anywhere near his best as he suffered his third second-round exit. He was joined by number six seed David Chisnall, who was beaten 3-2 in a sudden-death leg by Ricky Evans, who came into the tournament 46th in the PDC's Order of Merit. The 2021 semi-finalist won the opening set, but then found himself 2-1 down to an inspired Evans, who was cheered on relentlessly by the Alexandra Palace crowd. He forced the game into a deciding set and faced match dart but Evans missed bullseye by the width of the wire. Chisnall then missed his own match dart on double tops, before he made a miscalculation when attempting to checkout 139 at 5-4 down. No real harm was done with a sudden-death leg forced but he was unable to hold off Evans, who reaches the third round for the third time in the last five years. \"It's not even what it is, again I've played a world-class darts player.

He was a leg away from defeat twice to his Northern Irish opponent, but came from behind to win the final set 6-5 in a sudden-death leg to win 3-2. Clayton, who will play Gurney in round three, lost the opening set of the match, but fought back to lead 2-1, before being pegged back again by 51-year-old Mansell, who then missed match darts on double tops in the deciding set. \"I was very emotional. I've got to be honest, that meant a lot,\" said Clayton, who is in the favourable half of the draw following shock second-round exits for former world champions Michael Smith and Gary Anderson. \"I had chances before and Mickey definitely had chances before. It wasn't great to play in, not the best - I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. \"There is a lot of weight off my shoulders after that. I know there is another gear or two in the bank, but I'll be honest that meant a lot to me, it is a tester and will try and make me believe again.\" Clayton was 2-0 down in the fifth set after consecutive 136 and 154 checkouts from Mansell, but won three legs on the trot in 15, 12 and 10 darts to wrestle a 3-2 lead. He missed three darts for the match, before his unseeded opponent held and broke Clayton's throw to lead 4-3. Mansell missed a match dart at double 20, before Clayton won on double five after two missed checkouts. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland's Josh Rock booked his place in the third round against England's Chris Dobey with a 3-0 win over Wales' Rhys Griffin.

Hurrell, 40, offered some resistance early on when taking the opening leg of the match, but he would win just two more as Van Gerwen proved far too strong. The third-seeded Dutchman averaged 94.85, took out two three-figure checkouts and hit 50% of his doubles - with six of his nine misses coming in one scrappy leg. Van Gerwen, 35, will now face either Brendan Dolan or Lok Yin Lee in the third round.\n",

Both men hit seven 180s in a match played at a fast and furious pace, but 34-year-old Hempel's superior doubles gave him a fourth straight first-round victory in the competition. Hempel moves on to a tie with 26th seed Daryl Gurney but it was a damaging loss for De Zwaan, 28, who came through a late qualifier in November and needed a good run here to keep his PDC tour card for next season.

Should Bunting progress further, he is seeded to face world number one and defending world champion Luke Humphries in the quarter-finals on New Year's Day. Elsewhere in Friday afternoon's session, the Dutch duo of Alexander Merkx and Wessel Nijman advanced to the second round with wins over Stephen Burton and Cameron Carolissen respectively. England's Ian White was handed a walkover victory against Sandro Eric Sosing of the Philippines. Sosing withdrew from the competition on medical grounds and was taken to hospital following chest pains.\n",

      "\n",
      "Christian Kist hit a nine-darter but lost his PDC World Championship first-round match to Madars Razma. The Dutchman became the first player to seal a perfect leg in the tournament since Michael Smith did so on the way to beating Michael van Gerwen in the 2023 final. Kist, the 2012 BDO world champion at Lakeside, collects £60,000 for the feat, with the same amount being awarded by sponsors to a charity and to one spectator inside Alexandra Palace in London. The 38-year-old's brilliant finish sealed the opening set, but his Latvian opponent bounced back to win 3-1. Darts is one of the few sports that can measure perfection; snooker has the 147 maximum break, golf has the hole-in-one, darts has the nine-dart finish. Kist scored two maximum 180s to leave a 141 checkout which he completed with a double 12, to the delight of more than 3,000 spectators. The English 12th seed, who has been troubled by wrist and back injuries, could next play Andrew Gilding in the third round - which begins on 27 December - should Gilding beat the winner of Martin Lukeman's match against qualifier Nitin Kumar. Aspinall faces a tough task to reach the last four again, with 2018 champion Rob Cross and 2024 runner-up Luke Littler both in his side of the draw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kist - who was knocked out of last year's tournament by teenager Littler - will still earn a bigger cheque than he would have got for a routine run to the quarter-finals. His nine-darter was the 15th in the history of the championship and first since the greatest leg in darts history when Smith struck, moments after Van Gerwen just missed his attempt. Darts fan Kris, a railway worker from Sutton in south London, was the random spectator picked out to receive £60,000, with Prostate Cancer UK getting the same sum from tournament sponsors Paddy Power. \"I'm speechless to be honest. I didn't expect it to happen to me,\" Kris said. \"This was a birthday present so it makes it even better. My grandad got me tickets. It was just a normal day - I came here after work.\" Kist said: \"Hitting the double 12 felt amazing. It was a lovely moment for everyone and I hope Kris enjoys the money. Maybe I will go on vacation next month.\" Earlier, Jim Williams was favourite against Paolo Nebrida but lost 3-2 in an epic lasting more than an hour. The Filipino took a surprise 2-1 lead and Williams only went ahead for the first time in the opening leg of the deciding set. The Welshman looked on course for victory but missed five match darts. UK Open semi-finalist Ricky Evans set up a second-round match against Dave Chisnall, checking out on 109 to edge past Gordon Mathers 3-2.\n",

In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a generative language model within LangChain.\n",

Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation."

    "# Using Couchbase as a caching mechanism\n",
    "Couchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.\n"
