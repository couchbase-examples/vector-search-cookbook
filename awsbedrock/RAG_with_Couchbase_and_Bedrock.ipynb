    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) as both the embedding and language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

    "# Perform Semantic Search\n",
    "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

The Scot, winner in 2015 and 2016, lost 3-0 to the Swede in a second-round shock at Alexandra Palace in London. \"Gary didn't really show up as he usually does. I'm very happy with the win,\" said De Graaf, 34, who had a 75% checkout success and began with an 11-dart finish. \"It's a dream come true for me. He's been my idol since I was 14 years old.\" Anderson, ranked 14th, became the 11th seed to be knocked out from the 24 who have played so far, and the fifth to fall on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came into the competition with the year's highest overall three-dart average of 99.66 but hit just three of his 20 checkout attempts to lose his opening match of the tournament for the first time. De Graaf will now meet Filipino qualifier Paolo Nebrida after he stunned England's Ross Smith, the 19th seed, in straight sets. Ritchie Edhouse, Dirk van Duijvenbode and Martin Schindler were the other seeds beaten on day eight. England's Callan Rydz, who hit a record first-round average of 107.06 on Thursday, followed up with a 3-0 win over 23rd seed Schindler on Sunday. The German missed double 12 for a nine-darter in the first set – the third player to do so in 24 hours after Luke Littler and Damon Heta – and ended up losing the leg. Rydz next meets Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, who hit six 180s and averaged 96 in a 3-0 win over Irishman Dylan Slevin.\n",

White, born in the same Cheshire town as the 17-year-old, acknowledged he would need to up his game in round three. Asked if he knew who was waiting for him, White joked: \"Yeah, Runcorn's number two. I'm from Runcorn and I'm number one.\" Ryan Searle started Sunday afternoon's action off with a 10-dart leg and went on to beat Matt Campbell 3-0, while Latvian Madars Razma defeated 25th seed Van Duijvenbode 3-1.

      "\n",
      "Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju shocked the world of chess on Thursday when he became the youngest world champion at the age of just 18. The Chennai-born prodigy defeated defending champion, China's Ding Liren, in a dramatic match staged in Singapore which he had entered as the challenger. The FIDE World Chess Championship carries a $2.5m (£1.96m) prize fund. It marked the peak to date of his career, his greatest moment in a long string of achievements. Gukesh became a grandmaster aged 12 years and seven months and even then, he was upfront about the fact that he dreamt of being the world champion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, he said he had harboured such ambitions since he was seven when he was a spectator at a World Title match between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen in 2013. As he confessed at the press conference following his dramatic win against Ding, he just didn't think it would happen so soon. \"Throughout the match I had several chances to clinch victories and many of the games which would have put me in the front foot quite seriously. But once I was getting close I was getting nervous and I was not able to finish him off,\" Gukesh told the BBC after the win. \"...And then all of a sudden...it was a sudden change and I could not process all the new information so quickly.\" Gukesh is the 18th world champion since Wilhelm Steinitz won what is considered the first title match way back in 1886. Born in May 2006, Gukesh is also, by far, the youngest player to have ascended this pinnacle. He comfortably improved upon the prior record held by Garry Kasparov (born April 1963) who was 22 when he won the title in Moscow in November 1985 by beating Anatoly Karpov. The 14-game match was tied with two wins each after 13 games. It looked as though the 14th game was heading for a draw. In that case, there would have been tiebreaks played at progressively shorter time controls. But Ding blundered on move 55 and Gukesh exploited the error to clinch the title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last three years the young player has made a string of extraordinary achievements, culminating in this victory. Gukesh won the individual gold medal for best performance in the last two Olympiads. He led India to a team bronze at Chennai in 2022 and the gold medal in 2024 in Budapest. He also won the Candidates - the tournament that earned him the right to challenge Ding Liren. Earlier in his teens, Gukesh was ruled out as a prospective challenger by his mentor, the former world champion Viswanathan Anand, or \"Vishy Sir\" as Gukesh calls him. He thought Gukesh simply didn't have enough experience. Indeed, Gukesh suffered an apparently catastrophic loss at the midway stage, but then he pulled himself together to win in the next round and eventually took the event. In the title match Gukesh lost the first game, and equalised with a win in game three, he then took the lead in game eleven and Ding equalised with a win in game 12. Game 14 was obviously high-tension with the title and a prize fund at stake, but the teenager controlled his nerves. Gukesh is obviously an extraordinary talent but this is not the romantic story of a lone ranger surprising the world. The Chennai GM is at the apex of a robust chess ecosystem, which is one of the best, perhaps the best, in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gukesh won Gold medals at the FIDE Chess Olympiad in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gukesh has also been strongly supported by his parents, by the chess establishment in India, and by his school. India has over 85 grandmasters, many of whom are not yet of driving age. Indian teams have succeeded recently, winning both the Open Gold (with Gukesh on top board) and the Women's gold at the last Olympiad in Budapest. Those grandmasters are at the tip of a pyramid with over 30,000 rated players, because a huge number of Indians play officially sanctioned tournaments. Gukesh has been a professional player since he was around 10 years old. He is mentored by Viswanathan Anand, who is himself a five-time world champion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spotlight is now shining on Gukesh, following his astounding rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is sponsored by Westbridge Capital, which supports the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy, a premier coaching centre run by Anand. Gukesh's parents are both doctors, his father Rajinikanth is a surgeon and mother Padma is a microbiologist. Both put their careers on hold to push their son. \"Initially I just used to watch my family members play chess at home, just as a hobby, just like any other board game. But then I got interested in the game and I happened to enrol in a chess summer camp in my school… there one of the coaches spotted I had good talent for that,\" Gukesh told the BBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gukesh's chess games have been live streamed to some schools in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chess becomes an expensive game when a child has to travel abroad for several months of every year, so his parents not only put their own earnings into supporting their son, they also asked friends to help crowd-fund Gukesh's career until it took off. Importantly, he also received support from his school, Velammal Vidyalaya in Mogappair, which allowed him to take leave. Gukesh has interests outside of chess too - he meditates, swims and plays tennis. His stated goals are simple - he wants to be the best chess player in the World – supplanting the current number one, Magnus Carlsen. He also wants to have a \"very long career at the top\". As he sees it, the title is only one step, albeit a very important one in that life journey.\n",

      "Score: 0.1003, Text: Glasgow Warriors opened their Investec Champions Cup campaign with a dominant bonus-point victory against visitors Sale Sharks. Scrum-half George Horne scored three of Glasgow's five first-half tries, with Kyle Rowe and Huw Jones also crossing. A penalty try and one by Arron Reed were Sale's scores before the break and Joe Carpenter went over in the second half. The United Rugby Championship winners led within three minutes in blistering style. Matt Fagerson held off a tackle and offloaded to Jones, who in turn fed Horne to speed through the resulting gap. Horne himself converted. Horne was on hand again to receive off a ruck then chase his own grubber kick to touch down on the opposite side, the right. His conversion attempt was wide, however. The wave of attacks kept coming at Sale and Warriors' quick handling from right to left unleashed Rowe to burst over and touch down in a central position for an easy Horne conversion. After such a chastening opening 20 minutes, Sharks composed themselves and were awarded a penalty try off a rolling maul and Horne was sent to the bin for coming in from the side. But Glasgow soon had their bonus point. Rory Darge's pick and go near the line set up Sebastian Cancelliere for the pass wide right for Jones to run in. Tom Jordan converted in Horne's absence. Sale still had their numerical advantage and went through the phases for Scotland wing Reed to ground on the left. Rob du Preez's pass had set up Reed but the fly-half's conversion swirled wide at a windy Scotstoun. Horne's hat-trick try owed much to the forcefulness of Jamie Bhatti's burst into the 22 before a side offload near the posts. Horne converted. Cummings appeared to take Carpenter out in the air early in the second half but avoided a yellow card. Carpenter was next to register, bustling his way through a throng before setting up a straightforward conversion for Du Preez. A bonus point and a losing bonus point were now on for Sale but Cummings put paid to those ambitions with Glasgow's sixth try off Horne's pass near the line. Horne's conversion was unsuccessful. Glasgow replacement Angus Fraser sat out the final seconds of the match following a yellow card for a high tackle on Raffi Quirke. Also in Pool 4, Toulon won 24-14 away to Stormers and Racing 92 beat visitors Harlequins 23-12. Warriors face Toulon away next Sunday (13:00 GMT), with Sale at home to Racing 92 on Friday (20:00).\n",

      "Scotland captain Sione Tuipulotu and four international team-mates - props Jamie Bhatti and Zander Fagerson and flankers Fagerson and Darge - returned to the Glasgow line-up and their quality shone through, particularly in the first half.

In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a generative language model within LangChain.\n",

    "The language model, equipped with the context from the retrieved documents, generates a response that is both informed and contextually accurate. This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase’s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while LangChain handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation."

The Scot, winner in 2015 and 2016, lost 3-0 to the Swede in a second-round shock at Alexandra Palace in London. \"Gary didn\\\\\\'t really show up as he usually does. I\\\\\\'m very happy with the win,\" said De Graaf, 34, who had a 75% checkout success and began with an 11-dart finish. \"It\\\\\\'s a dream come true for me. He\\\\\\'s been my idol since I was 14 years old.\" Anderson, ranked 14th, became the 11th seed to be knocked out from the 24 who have played so far, and the fifth to fall on Sunday.\\\\n\\\\nHe came into the competition with the year\\\\\\'s highest overall three-dart average of 99.66 but hit just three of his 20 checkout attempts to lose his opening match of the tournament for the first time. De Graaf will now meet Filipino qualifier Paolo Nebrida after he stunned England\\\\\\'s Ross Smith, the 19th seed, in straight sets. Ritchie Edhouse, Dirk van Duijvenbode and Martin Schindler were the other seeds beaten on day eight. England\\\\\\'s Callan Rydz, who hit a record first-round average of 107.06 on Thursday, followed up with a 3-0 win over 23rd seed Schindler on Sunday. The German missed double 12 for a nine-darter in the first set – the third player to do so in 24 hours after Luke Littler and Damon Heta – and ended up losing the leg. Rydz next meets Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, who hit six 180s and averaged 96 in a 3-0 win over Irishman Dylan Slevin.\\\\n\\\\nEngland\\\\\\'s Joe Cullen abruptly left his post-match news conference and accused the media of not showing him respect after his 3-0 win over Dutchman Wessel Nijman. Nijman, who has previously served a ban for breaching betting and anti-corruption rules, had been billed as favourite beforehand to beat 23rd seed Cullen. \"Honestly, the media attention that Wessel\\\\\\'s got, again this is not a reflection on him,\" Cullen said. \"He seems like a fantastic kid, he\\\\\\'s been caught up in a few things beforehand, but he\\\\\\'s served his time and he\\\\\\'s held his hands up, like a lot haven\\\\\\'t. \"I think the way I\\\\\\'ve been treated probably with the media and things like that - I know you guys have no control over the bookies - I\\\\\\'ve been shown no respect, so I won\\\\\\'t be showing any respect to any of you guys tonight. \"I\\\\\\'m going to go home. Cheers.\" Ian \\\\\\'Diamond\\\\\\' White beat European champion and 29th seed Edhouse 3-1 and will face teenage star Littler in the next round. White, born in the same Cheshire town as the 17-year-old, acknowledged he would need to up his game in round three. Asked if he knew who was waiting for him, White joked: \"Yeah, Runcorn\\\\\\'s number two. I\\\\\\'m from Runcorn and I\\\\\\'m number one.\" Ryan Searle started Sunday afternoon\\\\\\'s action off with a 10-dart leg and went on to beat Matt Campbell 3-0, while Latvian Madars Razma defeated 25th seed Van Duijvenbode 3-1. Seventh seed Jonny Clayton and 2018 champion Rob Cross are among the players in action on Monday as the second round concludes.

Indian chess champion Gukesh Dommaraju says he feels \\\\\\'really good\\\\\\'\\\\n\\\\nIndian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju shocked the world of chess on Thursday when he became the youngest world champion at the age of just 18. The Chennai-born prodigy defeated defending champion, China\\\\\\'s Ding Liren, in a dramatic match staged in Singapore which he had entered as the challenger. The FIDE World Chess Championship carries a $2.5m (£1.96m) prize fund. It marked the peak to date of his career, his greatest moment in a long string of achievements. Gukesh became a grandmaster aged 12 years and seven months and even then, he was upfront about the fact that he dreamt of being the world champion.\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, he said he had harboured such ambitions since he was seven when he was a spectator at a World Title match between Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen in 2013. As he confessed at the press conference following his dramatic win against Ding, he just didn\\\\\\'t think it would happen so soon. \"Throughout the match I had several chances to clinch victories and many of the games which would have put me in the front foot quite seriously. But once I was getting close I was getting nervous and I was not able to finish him off,\" Gukesh told the BBC after the win. \"...And then all of a sudden...it was a sudden change and I could not process all the new information so quickly.\" Gukesh is the 18th world champion since Wilhelm Steinitz won what is considered the first title match way back in 1886. Born in May 2006, Gukesh is also, by far, the youngest player to have ascended this pinnacle. He comfortably improved upon the prior record held by Garry Kasparov (born April 1963) who was 22 when he won the title in Moscow in November 1985 by beating Anatoly Karpov. The 14-game match was tied with two wins each after 13 games. It looked as though the 14th game was heading for a draw. In that case, there would have been tiebreaks played at progressively shorter time controls. But Ding blundered on move 55 and Gukesh exploited the error to clinch the title.\\\\n\\\\nOver the last three years the young player has made a string of extraordinary achievements, culminating in this victory. Gukesh won the individual gold medal for best performance in the last two Olympiads. He led India to a team bronze at Chennai in 2022 and the gold medal in 2024 in Budapest. He also won the Candidates - the tournament that earned him the right to challenge Ding Liren. Earlier in his teens, Gukesh was ruled out as a prospective challenger by his mentor, the former world champion Viswanathan Anand, or \"Vishy Sir\" as Gukesh calls him. He thought Gukesh simply didn\\\\\\'t have enough experience. Indeed, Gukesh suffered an apparently catastrophic loss at the midway stage, but then he pulled himself together to win in the next round and eventually took the event. In the title match Gukesh lost the first game, and equalised with a win in game three, he then took the lead in game eleven and Ding equalised with a win in game 12. Game 14 was obviously high-tension with the title and a prize fund at stake, but the teenager controlled his nerves. Gukesh is obviously an extraordinary talent but this is not the romantic story of a lone ranger surprising the world. The Chennai GM is at the apex of a robust chess ecosystem, which is one of the best, perhaps the best, in the world.\\\\n\\\\nGukesh won Gold medals at the FIDE Chess Olympiad in September.\\\\n\\\\nGukesh has also been strongly supported by his parents, by the chess establishment in India, and by his school. India has over 85 grandmasters, many of whom are not yet of driving age. Indian teams have succeeded recently, winning both the Open Gold (with Gukesh on top board) and the Women\\\\\\'s gold at the last Olympiad in Budapest. Those grandmasters are at the tip of a pyramid with over 30,000 rated players, because a huge number of Indians play officially sanctioned tournaments. Gukesh has been a professional player since he was around 10 years old. He is mentored by Viswanathan Anand, who is himself a five-time world champion.\\\\n\\\\nThe spotlight is now shining on Gukesh, following his astounding rise.\\\\n\\\\nHe is sponsored by Westbridge Capital, which supports the Westbridge Anand Chess Academy, a premier coaching centre run by Anand. Gukesh\\\\\\'s parents are both doctors, his father Rajinikanth is a surgeon and mother Padma is a microbiologist. Both put their careers on hold to push their son. \"Initially I just used to watch my family members play chess at home, just as a hobby, just like any other board game. But then I got interested in the game and I happened to enrol in a chess summer camp in my school… there one of the coaches spotted I had good talent for that,\" Gukesh told the BBC.\\\\n\\\\nGukesh\\\\\\'s chess games have been live streamed to some schools in India.\\\\n\\\\nChess becomes an expensive game when a child has to travel abroad for several months of every year, so his parents not only put their own earnings into supporting their son, they also asked friends to help crowd-fund Gukesh\\\\\\'s career until it took off. Importantly, he also received support from his school, Velammal Vidyalaya in Mogappair, which allowed him to take leave. Gukesh has interests outside of chess too - he meditates, swims and plays tennis. His stated goals are simple - he wants to be the best chess player in the World – supplanting the current number one, Magnus Carlsen. He also wants to have a \"very long career at the top\". As he sees it, the title is only one step, albeit a very important one in that life journey.\\'), Document(id=\\'e44911da260148c6811531bb02080c61\\', metadata={}, page_content=\"Glasgow Warriors opened their Investec Champions Cup campaign with a dominant bonus-point victory against visitors Sale Sharks. Scrum-half George Horne scored three of Glasgow\\'s five first-half tries, with Kyle Rowe and Huw Jones also crossing. A penalty try and one by Arron Reed were Sale\\'s scores before the break and Joe Carpenter went over in the second half. The United Rugby Championship winners led within three minutes in blistering style. Matt Fagerson held off a tackle and offloaded to Jones, who in turn fed Horne to speed through the resulting gap. Horne himself converted. Horne was on hand again to receive off a ruck then chase his own grubber kick to touch down on the opposite side, the right. His conversion attempt was wide, however. The wave of attacks kept coming at Sale and Warriors\\' quick handling from right to left unleashed Rowe to burst over and touch down in a central position for an easy Horne conversion. After such a chastening opening 20 minutes, Sharks composed themselves and were awarded a penalty try off a rolling maul and Horne was sent to the bin for coming in from the side. But Glasgow soon had their bonus point. Rory Darge\\'s pick and go near the line set up Sebastian Cancelliere for the pass wide right for Jones to run in. Tom Jordan converted in Horne\\'s absence. Sale still had their numerical advantage and went through the phases for Scotland wing Reed to ground on the left. Rob du Preez\\'s pass had set up Reed but the fly-half\\'s conversion swirled wide at a windy Scotstoun. Horne\\'s hat-trick try owed much to the forcefulness of Jamie Bhatti\\'s burst into the 22 before a side offload near the posts. Horne converted. Cummings appeared to take Carpenter out in the air early in the second half but avoided a yellow card. Carpenter was next to register, bustling his way through a throng before setting up a straightforward conversion for Du Preez. A bonus point and a losing bonus point were now on for Sale but Cummings put paid to those ambitions with Glasgow\\'s sixth try off Horne\\'s pass near the line. Horne\\'s conversion was unsuccessful. Glasgow replacement Angus Fraser sat out the final seconds of the match following a yellow card for a high tackle on Raffi Quirke. Also in Pool 4, Toulon won 24-14 away to Stormers and Racing 92 beat visitors Harlequins 23-12.

When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.\n"

Rangers manager Philippe Clement commented on the lack of a penalty award in Sunday\\\\\\'s League Cup final loss\\\\n\\\\nVAR officials made a \\\\\\'\\\\\\'really, really poor\\\\\\'\\\\\\' and \"unacceptable\" decision not to award Rangers a penalty against Celtic in Sunday\\\\\\'s Scottish League Cup final, admits Scottish FA head of referee operations Willie Collum. The Ibrox side, who lost the final on penalties after a 3-3 draw, were awarded a free-kick in extra time when Liam Scales was penalised by referee John Beaton for a pull on Vaclav Cerny right on the edge of the Celtic box. Footage shows that the infringement started outside the area but continued inside the 18-yard box. Collum has said VAR officials Alan Muir and assistant Frank Connor moved \"far too quickly\" in their analysis of the incident and were \"not forensic enough\". \"People will obviously hear me say that it\\\\\\'s wrong, but that\\\\\\'s not enough,\" he said on the Scottish FA\\\\\\'s VAR Review show., external \"We need to now understand why did we get it wrong and how do we make things better, how do we improve, what\\\\\\'s the lessons learned from this incident, because people will find it very hard to accept this error. \"It\\\\\\'s a really, really poor decision. It\\\\\\'s an unacceptable decision. The VAR team know that, everyone in refereeing knows it.\\\\n\\\\nThe Scottish FA has also broadcast the conversation between the officials in which Muir says to Connor: \\\\\\'\\\\\\'The [pulling] is outside [the box]. Do you agree?\\\\\\'\\\\\\' Collum says the question should not have been framed in such a closed manner and that the penalty award was so obvious that there was no need to recommend an on field review by referee Beaton. Neither Muir or Connor will be on duty at matches this weekend. \"We will do our very, very best through our coaching, through our analysis, to make sure an incident like this never happens again,\" Collum added. \"But it\\\\\\'s a mistake, it\\\\\\'s a bad mistake. \"When you look at the TV pictures, this is not a difficult decision for the VAR team. They are not forensic enough in the analysis. They move far too quickly. \"I think they\\\\\\'re thrown because the majority of the Rangers player\\\\\\'s body is outside the area but that\\\\\\'s irrelevant because it\\\\\\'s the holding that they should be judging. \"They should be making sure they get a clear image to show them that continues into the penalty area.\" Addressing the Cerny and Scales incident in more detail, Collum said: \"There\\\\\\'s been a lot said about the Rangers player having a foot on penalty line. The foot is irrelevant. It\\\\\\'s about the holding only because that\\\\\\'s where the contact is. \"The holding begins outside the penalty area and then it continues on the line and even arguably beyond the line and fully into the penalty area. But, regardless, the fact it\\\\\\'s on the line, this should be considered as a penalty kick. \"The referee\\\\\\'s awarded the free-kick on the field, he sees the pulling, he\\\\\\'s correctly judged the incident in terms of the foul play. \"But then the VAR team need to go into a check and decide whether this incident is inside or outside and ultimately, they failed to come to the correct conclusion, which is this should have been a factual overturn. \"There\\\\\\'s no need for the referee to go to the monitor - a factual overturn for a penalty kick to be awarded.\"\\\\n\\\\nRangers noted \"the Scottish FA\\\\\\'s admission of an officiating failure following the non-award of a penalty\". And the club added: \"For such a failure to occur during one of Scotland\\\\\\'s showcase matches is not only hugely disappointing for the club and its supporters, but also damaging for the credibility of Scottish football more widely. \"We acknowledge the Scottish FA\\\\\\'s determination to use this and other decision-making failures as opportunities to drive improvements in officiating standards. \"As a club, we will continue to engage with the Scottish FA in an attempt to improve officiating standards for the benefit of all clubs in Scotland.\"\\\\n\\\\nCollum backed the decision to dismiss Robbie Deas for his challenge on Hearts\\\\\\' Kenneth Vargas in Kilmarnock\\\\\\'s 1-0 Scottish Premiership win on Sunday. Furthermore, he said downgrading a red card for St Mirren\\\\\\'s Alex Gogic following his tackle on Aberdeen\\\\\\'s Shayden Morris was also the right call in the Paisley side\\\\\\'s 2-1 win in November. Furthermore, Collum agreed with the decision not to award Rangers a penalty for a suspected handball by St Johnstone\\\\\\'s Jack Sanders at McDiarmid Park in early December, which the visitors won 1-0. However, Collum said there should have been an on-field review of Dundee United goalkeeper Jack Walton\\\\\\'s booking for a foul on St Mirren forward Toyosi Olusanya and a red card recommended in United\\\\\\'s 2-0 win in November. The referee head believed Aberdeen defender Jack Milne should have been dismissed for a challenge on Hearts midfielder Beni Baningime in their 1-1 draw on 1 December.\\'), Document(id=\\'24250e59153c4a96be65fb52ec768ec8\\', metadata={}, page_content=\\'Watch as India\\\\\\'s Virat Kohli and Australian debutant Sam Konstas engage in a \"spicy\" altercation after bumping shoulders on the first day of the fourth Test at the MCG, Melbourne.\\\\n\\\\nWATCH MORE: \\\\\\'Unbelievable\\\\\\' Konstas ramps Bumrah three times in over\\\\n\\\\nAvailable to UK users only.\\'), Document(id=\\'e44911da260148c6811531bb02080c61\\', metadata={}, page_content=\"Glasgow Warriors opened their Investec Champions Cup campaign with a dominant bonus-point victory against visitors Sale Sharks. Scrum-half George Horne scored three of Glasgow\\'s five first-half tries, with Kyle Rowe and Huw Jones also crossing. A penalty try and one by Arron Reed were Sale\\'s scores before the break and Joe Carpenter went over in the second half. The United Rugby Championship winners led within three minutes in blistering style. Matt Fagerson held off a tackle and offloaded to Jones, who in turn fed Horne to speed through the resulting gap. Horne himself converted. Horne was on hand again to receive off a ruck then chase his own grubber kick to touch down on the opposite side, the right. His conversion attempt was wide, however. The wave of attacks kept coming at Sale and Warriors\\' quick handling from right to left unleashed Rowe to burst over and touch down in a central position for an easy Horne conversion. After such a chastening opening 20 minutes, Sharks composed themselves and were awarded a penalty try off a rolling maul and Horne was sent to the bin for coming in from the side. But Glasgow soon had their bonus point. Rory Darge\\'s pick and go near the line set up Sebastian Cancelliere for the pass wide right for Jones to run in. Tom Jordan converted in Horne\\'s absence. Sale still had their numerical advantage and went through the phases for Scotland wing Reed to ground on the left. Rob du Preez\\'s pass had set up Reed but the fly-half\\'s conversion swirled wide at a windy Scotstoun. Horne\\'s hat-trick try owed much to the forcefulness of Jamie Bhatti\\'s burst into the 22 before a side offload near the posts. Horne converted. Cummings appeared to take Carpenter out in the air early in the second half but avoided a yellow card. Carpenter was next to register, bustling his way through a throng before setting up a straightforward conversion for Du Preez. A bonus point and a losing bonus point were now on for Sale but Cummings put paid to those ambitions with Glasgow\\'s sixth try off Horne\\'s pass near the line. Horne\\'s conversion was unsuccessful. Glasgow replacement Angus Fraser sat out the final seconds of the match following a yellow card for a high tackle on Raffi Quirke. Also in Pool 4, Toulon won 24-14 away to Stormers and Racing 92 beat visitors Harlequins 23-12. Warriors face Toulon away next Sunday (13:00 GMT), with Sale at home to Racing 92 on Friday (20:00).\\\\n\\\\nScotland captain Sione Tuipulotu and four international team-mates - props Jamie Bhatti and Zander Fagerson and flankers Fagerson and Darge - returned to the Glasgow line-up and their quality shone through, particularly in the first half. By contrast, Sale were shorn England trio Luke Cowan-Dickie, Ben Curry and George Ford while lock Johnny Hill came off the bench following a 10-week suspension. Asher Opoku-Fordjour\\'s return at tight-head featured a stunning first-half carry that eventually led to the Reed try but Sharks lacked more of those moments in the plummeting temperatures. If Warriors\\' first half was all about attack, their defence in the second was almost as impressive, repelling most of what came at them.\\\\n\\\\nReplacements: Dobie for Cancelliere (65), Weir for Jordan (66), Sutherland for Bhatti (53), Matthews for Hiddleston (53), Talakai for Z Fagerson (53), Samuel for Oguntibeju (53), Fraser for Darge (73), Mann for Venter (66).
