Very convenient to several small but good restaurants. Very clean and well maintained. Housekeeping and other staff are all friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed sitting on the 2nd floor terrace over the entrance and \"people-watching\" on Esplanade Ave., also talking with our fellow guests. Some furniture could use a little updating or replacement, but nothing major.\n",

      "Content: We found the hotel de la Monnaie through Interval and we thought we'd give it a try while we attended a conference in New Orleans. This place was a perfect location and it definitely beat staying downtown at the Hilton with the rest of the attendees. We were right on the edge of the French Quarter withing walking distance of the whole area. The location on Esplanade is more of a residential area so you are near the fun but far enough away to enjoy some quiet downtime. We loved the trolly car right across the street and we took that down to the conference center for the conference days we attended. We also took it up Canal Street and nearly delivered to the WWII museum. From there we were able to catch a ride to the Garden District - a must see if you love old architecture - beautiful old homes(mansions). We at lunch ate Joey K's there and it was excellent. We ate so many places in the French Quarter I can't remember all the names. My husband loved all the NOL foods - gumbo, jambalya and more. I'm glad we found the Louisiana Pizza Kitchen right on the other side of the U.S. Mint (across the street from Monnaie). Small little spot but excellent pizza! The day we arrived was a huge jazz festival going on across the street. However, once in our rooms, you couldn't hear any outside noise. Just the train at night blowin it's whistle! We enjoyed being so close to the French Market and within walking distance of all the sites to see. And you can't pass up the Cafe du Monde down the street - a busy happenning place with the best French dougnuts!!!Delicious! We will defintely come back and would stay here again. We were not hounded to purchase anything. My husband only received one phone call regarding timeshare and the woman was very pleasant. The staff was laid back and friendly. My only complaint was the very firm bed. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Hotel de la Monnaie!\n",

During the week of the 9th March, we stayed at this hotel for a few days. When we checked out, we drove direction Baton Rouge. As we arrived, we found out that my husband had lost his back bag with all documents, passport, computer, etc. somewhere... The recepcionist in Super 8 La Place helped us a lot. We were very nervous, and she even let us phone to New Orleans just to check if our bag was there. No news, but finally, we decided to drove back to New Orleans. As we arrived the recepcionist, Nimahs, helped us a lot! Security guy, Dal, also. But as they didnÂ´t know about the lost bag, we asked to check the security cameras. The responsible guy came, and checked the cameras with my husband. Thanks to that, the bag was found! Happy end of the history thanks to that people! No one accepted any tips from us. We surely will recomend Super 8 hotels from now on. On the other hand, I must say that this is not a well located hotel if you want to party every night in the French Quarter. But we thought it was a good choice, also thinking about prices, and because we had our own car.\n",

      "Content: We read reviews of motels in New Orleans before choosing this one based on good feedback from others. It turned out to be a good choice, for it was a comfortable stay and the staff obviously put a lot of effort into making it a quality establishment. When we left they even had staff doing work in the garden. The room itself was good, with two beds, a fridge and coffee maker. Amazingly, the wifi also worked in the room, which I found to be something of a rarity for places in this price range. The floor sloped slightly downwards, which was a bit odd, but it didn't matter at all. There is plenty of parking, even if the spaces are quite tight. The motel is equipped with a gym, which I didn't use, plus an outdoor pool, which looked quite good but was far too cold when I was there. The business center was very useful, for I was able to print out flight tickets. Breakfast was good (though waffles would enhance it!), but was packed away promptly at 9:30. It was good to fill up in the morning while watching the news before going into New Orleans for the day. That brings me to the location - it's not in an area that you'd want to walk around, but isn't too far from fast food places and is very close to the interstate, so it's easy to get into New Orleans itself. A lot of the motels in New Orleans are in this area. This is an impressive motel and I would happily stay here again if I was every lucky enough to be able to return to New Orleans.\n",

    "## Results and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The search results display the top 3 (or `k`) most semantically similar hotels based on your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you see in each result:**\n",
    "- **Hotel Name** (`page_content`): The value from the `text_key` field (hotel name).\n",
    "- **Metadata fields**:\n",
    "  - `reviews`: Customer reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Ranking Works\n",
    "1. Your natural language query (e.g., `\"Which hotels have good food?\"`) is embedded using the NVIDIA model (`nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2`).\n",
    "2. The query embedding is compared against the `vec_descr_review_state` field in each document using dot product similarity.\n",
    "3. Results are sorted by vector similarity. Higher similarity = closer semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "- The results are ranked by **semantic similarity**, not keyword matching. Hotels that conceptually match your query about \"infrastructure\" and \"service\" will rank higher, even if those exact words don't appear in the document.\n",
    "- By including extra `fields`, you get rich, contextual information beyond just the hotel name, making the results more actionable.\n",
    "- The embedding combines `description`, `reviews` and `state` fields, so the search understands the hotel's overall quality based on multiple data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your vector search pipeline is working if the returned documents feel meaningfully related to your natural language query—even when exact keywords do not match. Feel free to experiment with increasingly descriptive queries to observe the semantic power of the embeddings.\n"
