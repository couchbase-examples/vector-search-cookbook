        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com) as the embedding and LLM provider, and [Hugging Face smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index) as an agent framework. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

It then calls the `final_answer` tool, which is predefined for each agent: this tool is called when the agent returns the final answer to the user. In this step, the LLM answers the user's query from the context retrieved in step 1 and passes it to the `final_answer` tool, at which point the agent's execution ends."

This guide is designed not just to show you how to build the system, but also to explain why each step is necessary, giving you a deeper understanding of the principles behind semantic search and how to implement it effectively. Whether you’re a newcomer to software development or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to create a powerful, RAG-driven chat system."
