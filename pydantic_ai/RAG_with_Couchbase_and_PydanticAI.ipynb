        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com) as the embedding and LLM provider, and [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) as an agent orchestrator. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

Unlike traditional keyword-based search, which looks for exact matches, embeddings allow our search engine to understand the context and nuances of language, enabling it to retrieve documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact keywords. By creating embeddings using OpenAI, we equip our search engine with the ability to understand and process natural language in a way that's much closer to how humans understand language.
