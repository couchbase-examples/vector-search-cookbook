    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com) as the embedding and LLM provider, and [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) as an agent orchestrator. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using GSI (Global Secondary Index) from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the FTS index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-pydantic-ai-couchbase-rag-with-fts/)\n"

    "#  Setting Up the Couchbase Query Vector Store\n",
    "A vector store is where we'll keep our embeddings. The query vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, GSI converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables us to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector store requires a distance metric to determine how similarity between vectors is calculated. This is crucial for accurate semantic search results as different distance metrics can yield different similarity rankings. Some of the supported Distance strategies are dot, l2, euclidean, cosine, l2_squared, euclidean_squared. In our implementation we will use cosine which is particularly effective for text embeddings.\n"

    "\n",
    "> PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade applications with Generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "PydanticAI allows us to define agents and tools easily to create Gen-AI apps in an innovative and painless manner. Some of its features are:\n",
    "- Built by the Pydantic Team: Built by the team behind Pydantic (the validation layer of the OpenAI SDK, the Anthropic SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, Transformers, CrewAI, Instructor and many more).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model-agnostic: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Deepseek, Ollama, Groq, Cohere, and Mistral, and there is a simple interface to implement support for other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type-safe: Designed to make type checking as powerful and informative as possible for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python-centric Design: Leverages Python's familiar control flow and agent composition to build your AI-driven projects, making it easy to apply standard Python best practices you'd use in any other (non-AI) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structured Responses: Harnesses the power of Pydantic to validate and structure model outputs, ensuring responses are consistent across runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependency Injection System: Offers an optional dependency injection system to provide data and services to your agent's system prompts, tools and result validators. This is useful for testing and eval-driven iterative development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Streamed Responses: Provides the ability to stream LLM outputs continuously, with immediate validation, ensuring rapid and accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Support: Pydantic Graph provides a powerful way to define graphs using typing hints, this is useful in complex applications where standard control flow can degrade to spaghetti code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Building a RAG Agent using PydanticAI\n",
    "\n",
    "PydanticAI makes heavy use of dependency injection to provide data and services to your agent's system prompts and tools. We define dependencies using a `dataclass`, which serves as a container for our dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the only dependency for our agent to work is the `CouchbaseQueryVectorStore` instance. However, we will still use a `dataclass` as it is good practice. In the future, in case we wish to add more dependencies, we can just add more fields to the `dataclass` `Deps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also initialize an agent as a GPT-4o model. PydanticAI supports many different LLM providers, including Anthropic, Google, Cohere, etc. which can also be used. While initializing the agent, we also pass the type of the dependencies. This is mainly used for type checking, and not actually used at runtime.\n"

    "By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional semantic search engine that leverages the strengths of Couchbase and PydanticAI. This guide is designed not just to show you how to build the system, but also to explain why each step is necessary, giving you a deeper understanding of the principles behind semantic search and how it improves querying data more efficiently using GSI which can significantly improve your RAG performance. Whether you're a newcomer to software development or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to create a powerful, AI-driven search engine using PydanticAI's agent-based approach."
