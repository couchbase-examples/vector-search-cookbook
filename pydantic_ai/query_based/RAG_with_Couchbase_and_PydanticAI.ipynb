    "## Introduction\nIn this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com) as the embedding and LLM provider, and [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) as an agent orchestrator. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the Search Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-pydantic-ai-couchbase-rag-with-search-vector-index)\n"

    "## Understanding Hyperscale and Composite Vector Search\n\n### Optimizing Vector Search with Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index\n\nWith Couchbase 8.0+, you can leverage the power of query-based vector search, which offers significant performance improvements over traditional Full-Text Search (FTS) approaches for vector-first workloads. Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index search provides high-performance vector similarity search with advanced filtering capabilities and is designed to scale to billions of vectors.\n\n#### Hyperscale/Composite vs Search Vector Index: Choosing the Right Approach\n\n| Feature               | Hyperscale/Composite Vector Index                                               | Search Vector Index                         |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| **Best For**          | Vector-first workloads, complex filtering, high QPS performance| Hybrid search and high recall rates      |\n| **Couchbase Version** | 8.0.0+                                                         | 7.6+                                      |\n| **Filtering**         | Pre-filtering with `WHERE` clauses (Composite) or post-filtering (Hyperscale) | Pre-filtering with flexible ordering |\n| **Scalability**       | Up to billions of vectors (Hyperscale)                              | Up to 10 million vectors                  |\n| **Performance**       | Optimized for concurrent operations with low memory footprint  | Good for mixed text and vector queries   |\n\n\n#### Query-Based Vector Index Types\n\nCouchbase offers two distinct query-based vector index types, each optimized for different use cases:\n\n##### Hyperscale Vector Indexes\n\n- **Best for**: Pure vector searches like content discovery, recommendations, and semantic search\n- **Use when**: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering\n- **Features**: \n  - High performance with low memory footprint\n  - Optimized for concurrent operations\n  - Designed to scale to billions of vectors\n  - Supports post-scan filtering for basic metadata filtering\n\n##### Composite Vector Indexes\n\n  - **Best for**: Filtered vector searches that combine vector similarity with scalar value filtering\n- **Use when**: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data\n- **Features**: \n  - Efficient pre-filtering where scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope\n  - Best for well-defined workloads requiring complex filtering using Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index features\n  - Supports range lookups combined with vector search\n\n#### Index Type Selection for This Tutorial\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll demonstrate creating a **Hyperscale index** and running vector similarity queries using Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index. Hyperscale is ideal for semantic search scenarios where you want:\n\n1. **High-performance vector search** across large datasets\n2. **Low latency** for real-time applications\n3. **Scalability** to handle growing vector collections\n4. **Concurrent operations** for multi-user environments\n\nThe Hyperscale index will provide optimal performance for our OpenAI embedding-based semantic search implementation.\n\n#### Alternative: Composite Vector Index\n\nIf your use case requires complex filtering with scalar attributes, you may want to consider using a **Composite Vector Index** instead:\n\n```python\n## Alternative: Create a Composite index for filtered searches\nvector_store.create_index(\n    index_type=IndexType.COMPOSITE,\n    index_description=\"IVF,SQ8\",\n    distance_metric=DistanceStrategy.COSINE,\n    index_name=\"pydantic_composite_index\",\n)\n```\n\n**Use Composite indexes when:**\n- You need to filter by document metadata or attributes before vector similarity\n- Your queries combine vector search with WHERE clauses\n- You have well-defined filtering requirements that can reduce the search space\n\n**Note**: Composite indexes enable pre-filtering with scalar attributes, making them ideal for applications where you need to search within specific categories, date ranges, or user-specific data segments.\n\n#### Understanding Index Configuration (Couchbase 8.0 Feature)\n\nBefore creating our Hyperscale index, it's important to understand the configuration parameters that optimize vector storage and search performance. The `index_description` parameter controls how Couchbase optimizes vector storage through centroids and quantization.\n\n##### Index Description Format: `'IVF[<centroids>],{PQ|SQ}<settings>'`\n\n##### Centroids (IVF - Inverted File)\n\n- Controls how the dataset is subdivided for faster searches\n- **More centroids** = faster search, slower training time\n- **Fewer centroids** = slower search, faster training time\n- If omitted (like `IVF,SQ8`), Couchbase auto-selects based on dataset size\n\n###### Quantization Options\n\n**Scalar Quantization (SQ):**\n- `SQ4`, `SQ6`, `SQ8` (4, 6, or 8 bits per dimension)\n- Lower memory usage, faster search, slightly reduced accuracy\n\n**Product Quantization (PQ):**\n- Format: `PQ<subquantizers>x<bits>` (e.g., `PQ32x8`)\n- Better compression for very large datasets\n- More complex but can maintain accuracy with smaller index size\n\n##### Common Configuration Examples\n\n- **`IVF,SQ8`** - Auto centroids, 8-bit scalar quantization (good default)\n- **`IVF1000,SQ6`** - 1000 centroids, 6-bit scalar quantization\n- **`IVF,PQ32x8`** - Auto centroids, 32 subquantizers with 8 bits\n\nFor detailed configuration options, see the [Quantization & Centroid Settings](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/hyperscale-vector-index.html#algo_settings).\n\nFor more information on query-based vector indexes, see [Couchbase Vector Index Documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/use-vector-indexes.html).\n\n##### Our Configuration Choice\n\nIn this tutorial, we use `IVF,SQ8` which provides:\n- **Auto-selected centroids** optimized for our dataset size\n- **8-bit scalar quantization** for good balance of speed, memory usage, and accuracy\n- **COSINE distance metric** ideal for semantic similarity search\n- **Optimal performance** for most semantic search use cases"

   "source": "##  Setting Up the Couchbase Query Vector Store\nA vector store is where we'll keep our embeddings. The query vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the Couchbase Query Service converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables us to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used.\n\nThe vector store requires a distance metric to determine how similarity between vectors is calculated. This is crucial for accurate semantic search results as different distance metrics can yield different similarity rankings. Some of the supported Distance strategies are dot, l2, euclidean, cosine, l2_squared, euclidean_squared. In our implementation we will use cosine which is particularly effective for text embeddings."

    "## Saving Data to the Vector Store\nTo efficiently handle the large number of articles, we process them in batches of articles at a time. This batch processing approach helps manage memory usage and provides better control over the ingestion process.\n\nWe first filter out any articles that exceed 50,000 characters to avoid potential issues with token limits. Then, using the vector store's add_texts method, we add the filtered articles to our vector database. The batch_size parameter controls how many articles are processed in each iteration.\n\nThis approach offers several benefits:\n1. Memory Efficiency: Processing in smaller batches prevents memory overload\n2. Progress Tracking: Easier to monitor and track the ingestion progress\n3. Resource Management: Better control over CPU and network resource utilization\n\nWe use a conservative batch size of 100 to ensure reliable operation.\nThe optimal batch size depends on many factors including:\n- Document sizes being inserted\n- Available system resources\n- Network conditions\n- Concurrent workload\n\nConsider measuring performance with your specific workload before adjusting.\n"

    "## Understanding Semantic Search in Couchbase\n\nSemantic search goes beyond traditional keyword matching by understanding the meaning and context behind queries. Here's how it works in Couchbase:\n\n## How Semantic Search Works\n\n1. **Vector Embeddings**: Documents and queries are converted into high-dimensional vectors using an embeddings model (in our case, OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small)\n\n2. **Similarity Calculation**: When a query is made, Couchbase compares the query vector against stored document vectors using the COSINE distance metric\n\n3. **Result Ranking**: Documents are ranked by their vector distance (lower distance = more similar meaning)\n\n4. **Flexible Configuration**: Different distance metrics (cosine, euclidean, dot product) and embedding models can be used based on your needs\n\nThe `similarity_search_with_score` method performs this entire process, returning documents along with their similarity scores. This enables you to find semantically related content even when exact keywords don't match.\n\nNow let's see semantic search in action and measure its performance with different optimization strategies."

    "## PydanticAI: An Introduction\nFrom [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/)'s website:\n\n> PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade applications with Generative AI.\n\nPydanticAI allows us to define agents and tools easily to create Gen-AI apps in an innovative and painless manner. Some of its features are:\n- Built by the Pydantic Team: Built by the team behind Pydantic (the validation layer of the OpenAI SDK, the Anthropic SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, Transformers, CrewAI, Instructor and many more).\n\n- Model-agnostic: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Deepseek, Ollama, Groq, Cohere, and Mistral, and there is a simple interface to implement support for other models.\n\n- Type-safe: Designed to make type checking as powerful and informative as possible for you.\n\n- Python-centric Design: Leverages Python's familiar control flow and agent composition to build your AI-driven projects, making it easy to apply standard Python best practices you'd use in any other (non-AI) project.\n\n- Structured Responses: Harnesses the power of Pydantic to validate and structure model outputs, ensuring responses are consistent across runs.\n\n- Dependency Injection System: Offers an optional dependency injection system to provide data and services to your agent's system prompts, tools and result validators. This is useful for testing and eval-driven iterative development.\n\n- Streamed Responses: Provides the ability to stream LLM outputs continuously, with immediate validation, ensuring rapid and accurate results.\n\n- Graph Support: Pydantic Graph provides a powerful way to define graphs using typing hints, this is useful in complex applications where standard control flow can degrade to spaghetti code.\n\n## Building a RAG Agent using PydanticAI\n\nPydanticAI makes heavy use of dependency injection to provide data and services to your agent's system prompts and tools. We define dependencies using a `dataclass`, which serves as a container for our dependencies.\n\nIn our case, the only dependency for our agent to work is the `CouchbaseQueryVectorStore` instance. However, we will still use a `dataclass` as it is good practice. In the future, in case we wish to add more dependencies, we can just add more fields to the `dataclass` `Deps`.\n\nWe also initialize an agent as a GPT-4o model. PydanticAI supports many different LLM providers, including Anthropic, Google, Cohere, etc. which can also be used. While initializing the agent, we also pass the type of the dependencies. This is mainly used for type checking, and not actually used at runtime.\n"

    "## Defining the Vector Store as a Tool\nPydanticAI has the concept of `function tools`, which are functions that can be called by LLMs to retrieve extra information that can help form a better response.\n\nWe can perform RAG by creating a tool which retrieves documents that are semantically similar to the query, and allowing the agent to call the tool when required. We can add the function as a tool using the `@agent.tool` decorator.\n\nNotice that we also add the `context` parameter, which contains the dependencies that are passed to the tool (in this case, the only dependency is the vector store).\n"

Despite the challenges, Guardiola remains supported by the club and its fans, who continue to reassess their situation as they aim to return to form.\n",

The `retrieve` tool returns a `ToolReturnPart` object with all the context required for the model to answer the user's query.
