    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [AzureOpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using Couchbase Search Vector Index from scratch. For guidance on choosing the right vector index for your use case, see the [Couchbase documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/vector-search/choose-the-right-vector-index.html). Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using Couchbase Hyperscale or Composite Vector Indexes, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-azure-openai-couchbase-rag-with-hyperscale-or-composite-vector-index/)"

    "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseSearchVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."
