        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [AzureOpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using GSI( Global Secondary Index) from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the FTS index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-azure-openai-couchbase-rag-with-fts/)"

        "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the `similarity_search_with_score` method of the `CouchbaseQueryVectorStore`. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and the distance that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

            "One year ago, he was barely a household name in his own home. Now he is a sporting phenomenon. After emerging from obscurity aged 16 to reach the World Championship final, the life of Luke Littler and the sport he loves has been transformed. Viewing figures, ticket sales and social media interest have rocketed. Darts has hit the bullseye. This Christmas more than 100,000 children are expected to be opening Littler-branded magnetic dartboards as presents. His impact has helped double the number of junior academies, prompted plans to expand the World Championship and generated interest in darts from Saudi Arabian backers.\n",

            "Just months after taking his GCSE exams and ranked 164th in the world, Littler beat former champions Raymond van Barneveld and Rob Cross en route to the PDC World Championship final in January, before his run ended with a 7-4 loss to Luke Humphries. With his nickname 'The Nuke' on his purple and yellow shirt and the Alexandra Palace crowd belting out his walk-on song, Pitbull's tune Greenlight, he became an instant hit. Electric on the stage, calm off it. The down-to-earth teenager celebrated with a kebab and computer games. \"We've been watching his progress since he was about seven. He was on our radar, but we never anticipated what would happen. The next thing we know 'Littlermania' is spreading everywhere,\" PDC president Barry Hearn told BBC Sport. A peak TV audience of 3.7 million people watched the final - easily Sky's biggest figure for a non-football sporting event. The teenager from Warrington in Cheshire was too young to legally drive or drink alcohol, but earned £200,000 for finishing second - part of £1m prize money in his first year as a professional - and an invitation to the elite Premier League competition. He turned 17 later in January but was he too young for the demanding event over 17 Thursday nights in 17 locations? He ended up winning the whole thing, and hit a nine-dart finish against Humphries in the final. From Bahrain to Wolverhampton, Littler claimed 10 titles in 2024 and is now eyeing the World Championship.\n",
            "\n",
            "As he progressed at the Ally Pally, the Manchester United fan was sent a good luck message by the club's former midfielder and ex-England captain David Beckham. In 12 months, Littler's Instagram followers have risen from 4,000 to 1.3m. Commercial backers include a clothing range, cereal firm and train company and he will appear in a reboot of the TV darts show Bullseye. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. On the back of his success, Littler darts, boards, cabinets, shirts are being snapped up in big numbers. \"This Christmas the junior magnetic dartboard is selling out, we're talking over 100,000. They're 20 quid and a great introduction for young children,\" said Garry Plummer, the boss of sponsors Target Darts, who first signed a deal with Littler's family when he was aged 12. \"All the toy shops want it, they all want him - 17, clean, doesn't drink, wonderful.\"\n",

            "The number of academies for children under the age of 16 has doubled in the last year, says Junior Darts Corporation chairman Steve Brown. There are 115 dedicated groups offering youngsters equipment, tournaments and a place to develop, with bases including Australia, Bulgaria, Greece, Norway, USA and Mongolia. \"We've seen so many inquiries from around the world, it's been such a boom. It took us 14 years to get 1,600 members and within 12 months we have over 3,000, and waiting lists,\" said Brown. \"When I played darts as a child, I was quite embarrassed to tell my friends what my hobby was. All these kids playing darts now are pretty popular at school. It's a bit rock 'n roll and recognised as a cool thing to do.\" Plans are being hatched to extend the World Championship by four days and increase the number of players from 96 to 128. That will boost the number of tickets available by 25,000 to 115,000 but Hearn reckons he could sell three times as many. He says Saudi Arabia wants to host a tournament, which is likely to happen if no-alcohol regulations are relaxed. \"They will change their rules in the next 12 months probably for certain areas having alcohol, and we'll take darts there and have a party in Saudi,\" he said. \"When I got involved in darts, the total prize money was something like £300,000 for the year. This year it will go to £20m. I expect in five years' time, we'll be playing for £40m.\"\n",

            "Former electrician Cross charged to the 2018 world title in his first full season, while Adrian Lewis and Michael van Gerwen were multiple victors in their 20s and 16-time champion Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor is widely considered the greatest of all time. Littler is currently fourth in the world rankings, although that is based on a two-year Order of Merit. There have been suggestions from others the spotlight on the teenager means world number one Humphries, 29, has been denied the coverage he deserves, but no darts player has made a mark at such a young age as Littler. \"Luke Humphries is another fabulous player who is going to be around for years. Sport is a very brutal world. It is about winning and claiming the high ground. There will be envy around,\" Hearn said. \"Luke Littler is the next Tiger Woods for darts so they better get used to it, and the only way to compete is to get better.\" World number 38 Martin Lukeman was awestruck as he described facing a peak Littler after being crushed 16-3 in the Grand Slam final, with the teenager winning 15 consecutive legs. \"I can't compete with that, it was like Godly. He was relentless, he is so good it's ridiculous,\" he said. Lukeman can still see the benefits he brings, adding: \"What he's done for the sport is brilliant. If it wasn't for him, our wages wouldn't be going up. There's more sponsors, more money coming in, all good.\" Hearn feels future competition may come from players even younger than Littler. \"I watched a 10-year-old a few months ago who averaged 104.89 and checked out a 4-3 win with a 136 finish. They smell the money, the fame and put the hard work in,\" he said. How much better Littler can get is guesswork, although Plummer believes he wants to reach new heights. \"He never says 'how good was I?' But I think he wants to break records and beat Phil Taylor's 16 World Championships and 16 World Matchplay titles,\" he said. \"He's young enough to do it.\" A version of this article was originally published on 29 November.\n",

            "A tearful Luke Littler hit a tournament record 140.91 set average as he started his bid for the PDC World Championship title with a dramatic 3-1 win over Ryan Meikle. The 17-year-old made headlines around the world when he reached the tournament final in January, where he lost to Luke Humphries. Starting this campaign on Saturday, Littler was millimetres away from a nine-darter when he missed double 12 as he blew Meikle away in the fourth and final set of the second-round match. Littler was overcome with emotion at the end, cutting short his on-stage interview. \"It was probably the toughest game I've ever played. I had to fight until the end,\" he said later in a news conference. \"As soon as the question came on stage and then boom, the tears came. It was just a bit too much to speak on stage. \"It is the worst game I have played. I have never felt anything like that tonight.\" Admitting to nerves during the match, he told Sky Sports: \"Yes, probably the biggest time it's hit me. Coming into it I was fine, but as soon as [referee] George Noble said 'game on', I couldn't throw them.\" Littler started slowly against Meikle, who had two darts for the opening set, but he took the lead by twice hitting double 20. Meikle did not look overawed against his fellow Englishman and levelled, but Littler won the third set and exploded into life in the fourth. The tournament favourite hit four maximum 180s as he clinched three straight legs in 11, 10 and 11 darts for a record set average, and 100.85 overall. Meanwhile, two seeds crashed out on Saturday night – five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld lost to Welshman Nick Kenny, while England's Ryan Joyce beat Danny Noppert. Australian Damon Heta was another to narrowly miss out on a nine-darter, just failing on double 12 when throwing for the match in a 3-1 win over Connor Scutt. Ninth seed Heta hit four 100-plus checkouts to come from a set down against Scutt in a match in which both men averaged more than 97.\n",

He was on for a nine-darter after his opening two throws in both of the first two legs and completed the set in 32 darts - the minimum possible is 27. The teenager will next play after Christmas against European Championship winner Ritchie Edhouse, the 29th seed, or Ian White, and is seeded to meet Humphries in the semi-finals. Having entered last year's event ranked 164th, Littler is up to fourth in the world and will go to number two if he reaches the final again this time. He has won 10 titles in his debut professional year, including the Premier League and Grand Slam of Darts. After reaching the World Championship final as a debutant aged just 16, Littler's life has been transformed and interest in darts has rocketed. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. This Christmas, more than 100,000 children are expected to be opening Littler-branded magnetic dartboards as presents. His impact has helped double the number of junior academies and has prompted plans to expand the World Championship. Littler was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year on Tuesday and was runner-up to athlete Keely Hodgkinson for the main award.\n",

After emerging from obscurity aged 16 to reach the World Championship final, the life of Luke Littler and the sport he loves has been transformed. Viewing figures, ticket sales and social media interest have rocketed. Darts has hit the bullseye. This Christmas more than 100,000 children are expected to be opening Littler-branded magnetic dartboards as presents.

            "Just months after taking his GCSE exams and ranked 164th in the world, Littler beat former champions Raymond van Barneveld and Rob Cross en route to the PDC World Championship final in January, before his run ended with a 7-4 loss to Luke Humphries. With his nickname 'The Nuke' on his purple and yellow shirt and the Alexandra Palace crowd belting out his walk-on song, Pitbull's tune Greenlight, he became an instant hit. Electric on the stage, calm off it. The down-to-earth teenager celebrated with a kebab and computer games. \"We've been watching his progress since he was about seven. He was on our radar, but we never anticipated what would happen. The next thing we know 'Littlermania' is spreading everywhere,\" PDC president Barry Hearn told BBC Sport. A peak TV audience of 3.7 million people watched the final - easily Sky's biggest figure for a non-football sporting event. The teenager from Warrington in Cheshire was too young to legally drive or drink alcohol, but earned £200,000 for finishing second - part of £1m prize money in his first year as a professional - and an invitation to the elite Premier League competition. He turned 17 later in January but was he too young for the demanding event over 17 Thursday nights in 17 locations? He ended up winning the whole thing, and hit a nine-dart finish against Humphries in the final. From Bahrain to Wolverhampton, Littler claimed 10 titles in 2024 and is now eyeing the World Championship.\n",

            "As he progressed at the Ally Pally, the Manchester United fan was sent a good luck message by the club's former midfielder and ex-England captain David Beckham. In 12 months, Littler's Instagram followers have risen from 4,000 to 1.3m. Commercial backers include a clothing range, cereal firm and train company and he will appear in a reboot of the TV darts show Bullseye. Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024. On the back of his success, Littler darts, boards, cabinets, shirts are being snapped up in big numbers. \"This Christmas the junior magnetic dartboard is selling out, we're talking over 100,000. They're 20 quid and a great introduction for young children,\" said Garry Plummer, the boss of sponsors Target Darts, who first signed a deal with Littler's family when he was aged 12. \"All the toy shops want it, they all want him - 17, clean, doesn't drink, wonderful.\"\n",

            "The number of academies for children under the age of 16 has doubled in the last year, says Junior Darts Corporation chairman Steve Brown. There are 115 dedicated groups offering youngsters equipment, tournaments and a place to develop, with bases including Australia, Bulgaria, Greece, Norway, USA and Mongolia. \"We've seen so many inquiries from around the world, it's been such a boom. It took us 14 years to get 1,600 members and within 12 months we have over 3,000, and waiting lists,\" said Brown. \"When I played darts as a child, I was quite embarrassed to tell my friends what my hobby was. All these kids playing darts now are pretty popular at school. It's a bit rock 'n roll and recognised as a cool thing to do.\" Plans are being hatched to extend the World Championship by four days and increase the number of players from 96 to 128. That will boost the number of tickets available by 25,000 to 115,000 but Hearn reckons he could sell three times as many. He says Saudi Arabia wants to host a tournament, which is likely to happen if no-alcohol regulations are relaxed. \"They will change their rules in the next 12 months probably for certain areas having alcohol, and we'll take darts there and have a party in Saudi,\" he said. \"When I got involved in darts, the total prize money was something like £300,000 for the year. This year it will go to £20m. I expect in five years' time, we'll be playing for £40m.\"\n",

            "Former electrician Cross charged to the 2018 world title in his first full season, while Adrian Lewis and Michael van Gerwen were multiple victors in their 20s and 16-time champion Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor is widely considered the greatest of all time. Littler is currently fourth in the world rankings, although that is based on a two-year Order of Merit. There have been suggestions from others the spotlight on the teenager means world number one Humphries, 29, has been denied the coverage he deserves, but no darts player has made a mark at such a young age as Littler. \"Luke Humphries is another fabulous player who is going to be around for years. Sport is a very brutal world. It is about winning and claiming the high ground. There will be envy around,\" Hearn said. \"Luke Littler is the next Tiger Woods for darts so they better get used to it, and the only way to compete is to get better.\" World number 38 Martin Lukeman was awestruck as he described facing a peak Littler after being crushed 16-3 in the Grand Slam final, with the teenager winning 15 consecutive legs. \"I can't compete with that, it was like Godly. He was relentless, he is so good it's ridiculous,\" he said. Lukeman can still see the benefits he brings, adding: \"What he's done for the sport is brilliant. If it wasn't for him, our wages wouldn't be going up. There's more sponsors, more money coming in, all good.\" Hearn feels future competition may come from players even younger than Littler. \"I watched a 10-year-old a few months ago who averaged 104.89 and checked out a 4-3 win with a 136 finish. They smell the money, the fame and put the hard work in,\" he said. How much better Littler can get is guesswork, although Plummer believes he wants to reach new heights. \"He never says 'how good was I?' But I think he wants to break records and beat Phil Taylor's 16 World Championships and 16 World Matchplay titles,\" he said. \"He's young enough to do it.\" A version of this article was originally published on 29 November.\n",

The 17-year-old made headlines around the world when he reached the tournament final in January, where he lost to Luke Humphries. Starting this campaign on Saturday, Littler was millimetres away from a nine-darter when he missed double 12 as he blew Meikle away in the fourth and final set of the second-round match. Littler was overcome with emotion at the end, cutting short his on-stage interview. \"It was probably the toughest game I've ever played. I had to fight until the end,\" he said later in a news conference. \"As soon as the question came on stage and then boom, the tears came. It was just a bit too much to speak on stage. \"It is the worst game I have played. I have never felt anything like that tonight.\" Admitting to nerves during the match, he told Sky Sports: \"Yes, probably the biggest time it's hit me. Coming into it I was fine, but as soon as [referee] George Noble said 'game on', I couldn't throw them.\" Littler started slowly against Meikle, who had two darts for the opening set, but he took the lead by twice hitting double 20. Meikle did not look overawed against his fellow Englishman and levelled, but Littler won the third set and exploded into life in the fourth. The tournament favourite hit four maximum 180s as he clinched three straight legs in 11, 10 and 11 darts for a record set average, and 100.85 overall. Meanwhile, two seeds crashed out on Saturday night – five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld lost to Welshman Nick Kenny, while England's Ryan Joyce beat Danny Noppert. Australian Damon Heta was another to narrowly miss out on a nine-darter, just failing on double 12 when throwing for the match in a 3-1 win over Connor Scutt. Ninth seed Heta hit four 100-plus checkouts to come from a set down against Scutt in a match in which both men averaged more than 97.\n",

        "# Using Couchbase as a caching mechanism\n",
        "Couchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "For subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.\n"
