title: Building Intelligent Agents with Amazon Bedrock (Lambda)
short_title: AWS Bedrock Agents Lambda Approach
description:
  - Learn how to build intelligent agents using Amazon Bedrock Agents with AWS Lambda and Couchbase as the vector store.
  - This tutorial demonstrates how to create specialized agents that can process documents and interact with external APIs using serverless Lambda functions.
  - You'll understand how to implement secure multi-agent architectures using Amazon Bedrock's agent capabilities with a Lambda-based approach.
  - The Custom Control approach offers simpler setup and more direct control, but may not scale as well. You can find that implementation here: [Custom Control Approach Notebook](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-aws-bedrock-agents-custom-control)
