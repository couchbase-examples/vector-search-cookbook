    "This notebook demonstrates the Custom Control approach for implementing AWS Bedrock agents with Couchbase Vector Search. In this approach, the agent returns control to the application for function execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents for different tasks:\n",
    "- **Researcher Agent**: Searches for relevant documents in the vector store\n",
    "- **Writer Agent**: Formats and presents the research findings"

    "## Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Custom Control approach for AWS Bedrock Agents. For comparison, you might also want to check out the Lambda Approach, which uses AWS Lambda functions to execute agent tools instead of handling them directly in your application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambda approach offers better separation of concerns and scalability, but requires more setup. You can find that implementation here: [Lambda Approach Notebook](../lambda-approach/Bedrock_Agents_Lambda.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If the link above doesn't work in your Jupyter environment, you can navigate to the file manually in the `awsbedrock-agents/lambda-approach/` directory."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Custom Control approach gives the application invoking the agent the responsibility of executing the agent's defined functions (tools). When the agent decides to use a tool, it sends a `returnControl` event back to the calling application, which then executes the function locally and (optionally) returns the result to the agent to continue processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps & Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define Agent:**\n",
    "    *   Define instructions (prompt) for the agent.\n",
    "    *   Define the function schema (tools the agent can use, e.g., `researcher_functions`, `writer_functions` in the example).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Create Agent in Bedrock:**\n",
    "    *   Use `bedrock_agent_client.create_agent` to create the agent, providing the instructions and foundation model.\n",
    "    *   The example's `create_agent` function includes logic to check for existing agents and potentially delete/recreate them if they are in a non-functional state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Create Action Group (Custom Control):**\n",
    "    *   Use `bedrock_agent_client.create_agent_action_group`.\n",
    "    *   Crucially, set the `actionGroupExecutor` to `{\"customControl\": \"RETURN_CONTROL\"}`. This tells Bedrock to pause execution and return control to the caller when a function in this group needs to be run.\n",
    "    *   Provide the `functionSchema` defined earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Prepare Agent:**\n",
    "    *   Use `bedrock_agent_client.prepare_agent` to make the agent ready for invocation.\n",
    "    *   The `wait_for_agent_status` utility function polls until the agent reaches a `PREPARED` or `Available` state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Create Agent Alias:**\n",
    "    *   An alias (e.g., \"v1\") is created using `bedrock_agent_client.create_agent_alias` for invoking the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Invoke Agent & Handle Return Control:**\n",
    "    *   Use `bedrock_runtime_client.invoke_agent`, providing the `agentId`, `agentAliasId`, `sessionId`, and `inputText`. Set `enableTrace=True` for debugging.\n",
    "    *   Process the streaming response (`response['completion']`).\n",
    "    *   **Listen for `returnControl` events:** When the agent decides to use a function, the stream will contain an event with a `returnControl` key.\n",
    "    *   **Parse the Invocation:** Extract the `functionInvocationInput` from the `returnControl` event to get the `actionGroup`, `function` name, and `parameters`.\n",
    "    *   **Execute the Function Locally:** The example's `invoke_agent` function directly calls the corresponding Python function (e.g., `search_documents` imported from `utils`, or a simple formatting logic for `format_content`) using the extracted parameters. It has direct access to application state like the `vector_store` object.\n",
    "    *   **Handle the Result:**\n",
    "        *   *Note:* The provided example implementation **does not** seem to use the `ReturnControl` invocation type to send the function's result *back* to the *same* agent invocation to continue the turn.\n",
    "        *   Instead, it executes the function, gets the result (e.g., `search_results`), formats it into a string, and effectively *ends* that agent invocation, returning the formatted string as the `result`.\n",
    "        *   Subsequent steps (like formatting the research) involve a *new* call to `invoke_agent` for the writer agent, passing the result from the previous step as input. This differs from designs where the result is returned to the same agent turn for further reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Full Control:** The application has complete control over the execution environment and logic of the tools.\n",
    "*   **Direct State Access:** Tools can directly access application memory, state, and resources (like the `vector_store` object in the example) without needing separate deployment or complex configuration passing.\n",
    "*   **Simpler Local Development:** Can be easier to test and debug locally as the tool execution happens within the same process.\n",
    "*   **Flexibility:** Allows integration with any library or service available to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Application Burden:** The application code is responsible for implementing and executing the tool logic.\n",
    "*   **Scalability:** The scalability of tool execution is tied to the scalability of the application itself.\n",
    "*   **Tighter Coupling:** The agent's functionality is more tightly coupled with the application code.\n",
    "*   **Interaction Model:** The specific implementation shown requires chaining separate agent invocations rather than letting the agent continue processing within a single turn after a tool is used. Implementing the latter (returning results via `ReturnControl`) adds complexity to the application's handling of the `invoke_agent` response/request cycle. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've demonstrated the Custom Control approach for implementing AWS Bedrock agents with Couchbase Vector Search. This approach allows the agent to return control to the application for function execution, providing more flexibility and control over the agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of this implementation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Store Setup**: We set up a Couchbase vector store to store and search documents using semantic similarity.\n",
    "2. **Agent Creation**: We created two specialized agents - a researcher agent for searching documents and a writer agent for formatting results.\n",
    "3. **Custom Control**: We implemented the Custom Control approach, where the agent returns control to the application for function execution.\n",
    "4. **Function Handling**: We handled the agent's function calls in the application code, allowing for more control and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly useful when you need more control over the agent's behavior or when you want to integrate the agent with existing systems and data sources."
