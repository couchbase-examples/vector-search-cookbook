        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial uses Couchbase's **Global Secondary Index (GSI)** vector search capabilities, which offer high-performance vector search optimized for large-scale applications. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the FTS index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-crewai-couchbase-rag-using-fts)"
