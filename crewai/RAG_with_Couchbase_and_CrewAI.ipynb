    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

      "The 1929 Great Depression was caused by a combination of economic, political, and social factors that led to a profound global economic downturn. Here are the key causes with their supporting evidence:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Stock Market Crash of 1929**: \n",
      "   - The dramatic decline in stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1929 led to a loss of confidence and a reduction in consumer spending and investment. The crash wiped out many investors and set off a chain reaction of economic turmoil.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Bank Failures**: \n",
      "   - As the stock market declined, banks suffered huge losses because they had invested heavily in stocks. This led to widespread bank failures, reducing the money supply and causing panic withdrawals from banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reduction in Consumer Spending and Investment**: \n",
      "   - The loss of wealth from the stock market crash and bank failures led to a contraction in consumer spending and investment, which further exacerbated the economic downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy**:\n",
      "   - The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in the late 1920s to curb speculation inadvertently tightened credit and reduced money supply when the economy needed liquidity the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **International Trade and Tariffs**:\n",
      "   - The imposition of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised tariffs on hundreds of imported goods, led to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, reducing international trade and worsening the global depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Income Inequality**:\n",
      "   - Significant income inequality meant that a large portion of the American population did not have sufficient purchasing power to support economic growth, leading to overproduction and underconsumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "These causes, interlinked and exacerbated by global economic conditions, contributed to the severe economic downturn known as the Great Depression. Each factor played a role in creating a cycle of economic contraction, leading to widespread unemployment and hardship.\u001b[00m\n",

The crash resulted in a dramatic decline in stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange, leading to a significant loss of wealth.

      "**2. Bank Failures**\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the stock market collapse, banks, which had invested heavily in the stock market, suffered substantial losses. The financial instability led to widespread bank failures. As banks closed, the panic spread among the public, prompting mass withdrawals. This \"bank run\" scenario further reduced the money supply, exacerbating the economic crisis and eroding trust in the banking system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Reduction in Consumer Spending and Investment**\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of lost wealth from the stock market crash and bank failures led to a significant decrease in consumer spending and business investment. With less money circulating in the economy, demand for goods and services declined sharply, causing businesses to cut back production and lay off workers, which further deepened the economic downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. The Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy**\n",
      "\n",
      "In an attempt to curb rampant speculation in the stock market, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in the late 1920s. However, this policy inadvertently tightened credit at a time when the economy desperately needed liquidity. The reduced availability of credit stifled economic activity, further contracting the economy at a critical juncture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. International Trade and Tariffs**\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930 significantly worsened the economic situation. By increasing tariffs on hundreds of imported goods, the United States prompted retaliatory tariffs from other nations. This resulted in a steep decline in international trade, which not only affected the U.S. economy but also contributed to a global economic downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Income Inequality**\n",
      "\n",
      "A significant factor exacerbating the Depression was the stark income inequality prevalent in the U.S. during the 1920s. A large segment of the population did not have sufficient purchasing power, which led to overproduction by manufacturers and underconsumption by consumers. This imbalance contributed to economic stagnation as goods piled up unsold, leading to further production cuts and layoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Great Depression was not caused by a single factor but by a confluence of multiple, interconnected causes. The stock market crash, bank failures, reduced consumer spending, restrictive monetary policies, protectionist tariffs, and income inequality all played critical roles in creating a vicious cycle of economic contraction. Understanding these causes is essential for crafting informed economic policies that can prevent the recurrence of such a profound economic crisis. By learning from the past, policymakers can devise strategies to foster economic resilience and stability in the future.\n",
