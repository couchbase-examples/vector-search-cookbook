    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

    "How to run this tutorial\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) that you can run \n",
    "interactively. You can access the original notebook here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either:\n",
    "- Download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
    "- Run it on your system by setting up the Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start\n",
    "---------------\n",

    "1. Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up)\n",
    "   - To get started with [Couchbase Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com), create an account and use it to deploy \n",
    "     a forever free tier operational cluster\n",
    "   - This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn \n",
    "     about Capella with no time constraint\n",
    "   - To learn more, please follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "   When running Couchbase using Capella, the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) used in the application\n",
    "   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)"

Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the search engine converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."
