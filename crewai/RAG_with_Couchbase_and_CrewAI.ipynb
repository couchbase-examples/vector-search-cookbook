    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "   When running Couchbase using Capella, the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) used in the application\n",
    "   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)"

Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the search engine converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."

      "'Life is not easy' - Haaland penalty miss sums up Man City crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has now missed two of his 17 penalties taken in the Premier League\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing seems to be going Manchester City's way at the moment - and star striker Erling Haaland is not a happy man. If there was any player currently in the Premier League you would hand the ball to for a penalty to win a match, it would be the prolific Norwegian. Not on this occasion, though. Looking to land a knockout blow, Haaland saw his second-half strike saved by spot-kick expert Jordan Pickford, as Manchester City's crisis continued with a 1-1 draw against Everton at Etihad Stadium. \"How do you react mentally?\" asked boss Pep Guardiola about the penalty miss. \"Life is not easy. Sport is not easy. When it happens, it is OK. \"There are still a lot of minutes to play and we had the chances afterwards. We created, incredible how they ran and fight. In some games it was not good but today well played.\" At the full-time whistle, there were a smattering of boos from home supporters at Etihad Stadium and a despondent Haaland ripped off his hair bobble and shirt before heading straight down the tunnel. As Haaland trudged off out of sight, Guardiola stood motionless on the pitch with the look of a man unable to find answers to their current crisis. City's all-conquering side have suffered a remarkable drop-off and now won just once in their last 13 games in all competitions. In the post-match news conference, the stunned Spaniard was barely audible in the responses to the questions fired his way. \"My body language was positive,\" he uttered. \"The team played really good. We had I don't know how many shots. The first half was brilliant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "City have a lengthy injury list, but their downturn has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal. The striker made a blistering start to the campaign looked to be on his way to setting more goalscoring records when netting 10 goals in his first five games, but has only managed three in 13 since. This has largely been down to underperformance on his expected goal (xG) rate, with statistics showing he has scored five fewer goals than he should have done during this recent run. There is also a stark contrast from his shot conversion rate from the first five games to his last 13, dropping from 38.5% to a lowly 6.4%. The penalty miss was Haaland's only shot on target in the contest - but Everton did not set out to pay him extra attention. Asked if there had been a special plan to handle the frontman, Dyche said: \"No. I was asked the other day when playing Chelsea about Cole Palmer and what a great player he is turning out to be. \"We know Haaland is too but I believe in the team. I don't look at one aspect of it, I look at the team, what they are doing and they have done a good job today.\"\n",

      "Pickford saved his seventh penalty in the Premier League since joining Everton in 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "After Toffees forward Iliman Ndiaye had cancelled out Bernardo Silva's opener, the defining moment came in the second half when Vitalii Mykolenko tripped Savinho in the box. During the VAR check, it was a battle of the minds with Everton captain Seamus Coleman receiving a yellow card for trying to put off Haaland, who had the ball in his hand. The booking ultimately appeared to be a well-earned one for the team and Pickford seemed to revel in his big moment, jumping up and down on his line, sticking his tongue out before stooping low to his right to push the ball away. Pickford has made big penalty saves for England on the international stage and this was seventh spot-kick stop since joining Everton in 2017. Such is City's luck at the moment that they managed to recycle the ball and Haaland headed in, but it was ruled out for offside, much to the joy of the travelling supporters. Haaland had scored 15 of 16 of his previous penalties in the league, with the other hitting the woodwork, while this was the first he had seen saved. \"It is good from the analysts to give him as much benefit of as many penalties as they can,\" Dyche said of Pickford's save. \"Credit to him for making the right decision in the spur of the moment.\" Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Pickford is good at putting pressure on strikers. Haaland must have felt the pressure there, this place went silent. \"It was a decent save but a really poor penalty. He didn't whip it around like a left-footer should. A poor penalty, but a good save.\" Ex-England defender Matt Upson added on Amazon Prime: \"It was brilliant save from Pickford. He relishes situations like this. He doesn't make life any easier for the penalty taker. \"But for Haaland to miss that penalty speaks a bit about where the confidence is in this team at the moment.\"\n",

      "The club is now working with the council to improve its standards\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of mouse droppings at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium has led inspectors to downgrade the football club's food hygiene rating. Though no droppings were found in the actual kitchens, a council environmental health officer slashed the club's rating down from four to two out of five, following a visit in November. The club said a \"robust pest-control system\" was in place at the ground and included \"multiple weekly checks\" of all catering areas. Trafford Council said it was working closely with the club so \"necessary improvements\" were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Food Standards Agency rating scheme ranges from 0 (urgent improvement necessary) to 5 (very good). Manchester United's new score has seen it re-rated from good to \"some improvement is necessary\". About 250,000 people each season dine at Old Trafford on food prepared at the ground, according to the club. The club's pest-control teams were contacted soon after the rodents' droppings were discovered. \"If incidences of this nature do occur, immediate and appropriate action is taken,\" the club said. The downgrade comes amid wider discussions about a new stadium for Manchester United, with the club expected to reveal its plans next year.\n",

      "Postecoglou to 'double down' on Spurs approach\n",
      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou says he loves \"being in the middle of a storm\" and intends to \"double down\" on his principles amid his team's poor run of form. Spurs are 11th in the Premier League and winless in five games in all competitions after a 1-1 draw at Rangers on Thursday left them ninth in the Europa League table. \"I am here, I am in for the fight,\" said Postecoglou. \"I am in a fight, for sure. For better or worse I am not going anywhere at the moment because everything is still in my power and my responsibility. \"I still have a real desire to get us through this stage so that people see what is on the other side. My resolve and determination hasn't wavered one little bit. \"I love being in the middle of a storm when everyone doubts, because I know what it is on the other side if you get through it. My job is to get through it.\" Tottenham will aim to avoid a third straight league defeat when they visit bottom side Southampton on Sunday. A 4-3 defeat at home by London rivals Chelsea last weekend, despite leading 2-0, followed a 1-0 loss at Bournemouth, where Postecoglou confronted discontented supporters. Asked whether he would stick to his guns despite recent criticism, Postecoglou said: \"That is kind of where I sit. That doesn't mean I'm inflexible and you don't make slight adjustments, but in tough times you double down on your principles because if you get through there's nothing to fear ahead of you.\" Despite the club's injury concerns, Postecoglou added it would not be \"healthy\" to deviate from his long-term vision and dial down the intensity he expects his team to play with. \"It's a fine line. How much do you dilute for the situation you're in?\" added the Spurs boss. \"I always think, 'what's the long-term effect of it?' It may relieve some short-term pain but if that means people lose belief and conviction in what we're trying to do, because we have found an alternative path that alleviates that short-term stuff, I don't think that's healthy and gets us where we want to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The draw at Rangers left Postecoglu's side with only one win in eight games in all competitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Postecoglou also insisted he is not going to worry about the \"bruised egos\" of players after saying Timo Werner's performance \"wasn't acceptable\" in Thursday's draw at Rangers. Werner, 28, was substituted at half-time after losing possession 16 times, not winning any of his five duels and only completing 69% of his passes. The German forward's replacement, Dejan Kulusevski, scored Spurs' equaliser in the 75th minute at Ibrox. Postecoglou said he did not regret criticising Werner in public because his views were \"an assessment\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Chelsea player Werner, who is on loan from RB Leipzig, has only scored once in 19 appearances for Tottenham. \"Criticism is saying something that's not really helpful,\" added Postecoglou. \"Assessment is trying to give people feedback to try to make them better and give people the opportunity to improve. \"With Timo, it wasn't about whether he played well or not. It was a difficult game. I'm asking 18-year-olds to do difficult jobs. He's an international, he's won the Champions League, he's a senior player. There's a level of application you need to rise to, to raise the team. He didn't reach that. \"Timo is not where our season is at. It's not about Timo. It's not about bringing somebody down and blaming somebody.\" Spurs travel to Southampton on Sunday (19:00 GMT) with limited attacking options as both Richarlison and Wilson Odobert remain sidelined. Postecoglou admitted his side face a \"great challenge\", but wanted players \"who are up for that challenge\". \"We're in a fight here. I'm not going to go away worrying about people's bruised egos,\" added the Australian. \"We're here to win things. If there's somebody in the dressing room who's fit, who feels he needs something extra in this moment, he's probably not the right type.\" What do you make of Postecoglou's comments? Let us know below\n",

      "\n",
      "England won Euro 2022 on home soil beating Germany in the final at Wembley\n",
      "\n",
      "Uefa is \"not worried\" that some Women's Euro 2025 matches will clash with the Fifa men's Club World Cup, says managing director Nadine Kessler. Fifa's new expanded men's tournament takes place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July and involves 32 teams, including Chelsea and Manchester City. Switzerland is hosting Euro 2025 from 2-27 July, meaning five or six matches are likely to be played at the same time as some in the men's competition. \"Overall, I'm not really worried. We're talking about two tournaments, in two different countries, with two different timezones,\" said Kessler.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are also broadcasting agreements in place that differs from ours. Again, I'm not worried. \"As much as we always try to get full exclusivity for our women's football tournaments, in the times we live in, with our men's football tournaments having so many in a year, to get that privilege of full exclusivity is not easy any more. \"We must also stick to our plan because I think it's important we get a professional, respected international calendar in place for women's football. We have to co-exist.\" In May, Fifa rejected claims that Fifpro and the World Leagues Association were not consulted over its plans for the Club World Cup. BBC Sport asked Fifa to justify the scheduling clash with Euro 2025 this month. A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: \"The international match calendar for 2025-2030 was approved by the Fifa Council in 2023, which is made up of members from each of the six confederations, including Uefa. \"While Fifa accepts that both the men's and women's international match calendars are constrained by obvious limitations, this was deemed to be the most balanced solution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Uefa is aiming to sell out all matches at Euro 2025 and make it the most watched women's European football tournament. It has a target for a total attendance of more than 700,000. A portion of tickets went on sale on 1 October and over 200,000 have been sold. St Jakob Park in Basel will host the final with a capacity of 34,050. Uefa's events chief executive Martin Kallen said the tournament is getting \"bigger and bigger\" and this may be the last chance for such a small nation to host the Women's Euros. \"It's already at the edge for Switzerland to be able to do this Euros. I think they waited for the right moment to ask for it,\" said Kallen. \"They got it because in the future I think the stadiums and infrastructure in Switzerland is too small.\" The draw takes place on Monday, 16 December, when defending champions England and tournament debutants Wales will find out their group-stage opponents. Among Uefa's key objectives is an aim to meet \"men's Euros standards\" in terms of team facilities, football technology and analysis. Video assistant referee, goalline technology and semi-automated offsides will all be included. Artificial pitches in Bern and Thun will be overlaid with natural grass in June for the duration of the tournament in order to ensure conditions are the same across all venues. These pitches will be retained until September.\n",

      "Two-time champion Gary Anderson has been dumped out of the PDC World Championship on his 54th birthday by Jeffrey de Graaf. The Scot, winner in 2015 and 2016, lost 3-0 to the Swede in a second-round shock at Alexandra Palace in London. \"Gary didn't really show up as he usually does. I'm very happy with the win,\" said De Graaf, 34, who had a 75% checkout success and began with an 11-dart finish. \"It's a dream come true for me. He's been my idol since I was 14 years old.\" Anderson, ranked 14th, became the 11th seed to be knocked out from the 24 who have played so far, and the fifth to fall on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came into the competition with the year's highest overall three-dart average of 99.66 but hit just three of his 20 checkout attempts to lose his opening match of the tournament for the first time. De Graaf will now meet Filipino qualifier Paolo Nebrida after he stunned England's Ross Smith, the 19th seed, in straight sets. Ritchie Edhouse, Dirk van Duijvenbode and Martin Schindler were the other seeds beaten on day eight. England's Callan Rydz, who hit a record first-round average of 107.06 on Thursday, followed up with a 3-0 win over 23rd seed Schindler on Sunday. The German missed double 12 for a nine-darter in the first set – the third player to do so in 24 hours after Luke Littler and Damon Heta – and ended up losing the leg. Rydz next meets Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, who hit six 180s and averaged 96 in a 3-0 win over Irishman Dylan Slevin.\n",
      "\n",
      "England's Joe Cullen abruptly left his post-match news conference and accused the media of not showing him respect after his 3-0 win over Dutchman Wessel Nijman. Nijman, who has previously served a ban for breaching betting and anti-corruption rules, had been billed as favourite beforehand to beat 23rd seed Cullen. \"Honestly, the media attention that Wessel's got, again this is not a reflection on him,\" Cullen said. \"He seems like a fantastic kid, he's been caught up in a few things beforehand, but he's served his time and he's held his hands up, like a lot haven't. \"I think the way I've been treated probably with the media and things like that - I know you guys have no control over the bookies - I've been shown no respect, so I won't be showing any respect to any of you guys tonight. \"I'm going to go home. Cheers.\" Ian 'Diamond' White beat European champion and 29th seed Edhouse 3-1 and will face teenage star Littler in the next round. White, born in the same Cheshire town as the 17-year-old, acknowledged he would need to up his game in round three. Asked if he knew who was waiting for him, White joked: \"Yeah, Runcorn's number two. I'm from Runcorn and I'm number one.\" Ryan Searle started Sunday afternoon's action off with a 10-dart leg and went on to beat Matt Campbell 3-0, while Latvian Madars Razma defeated 25th seed Van Duijvenbode 3-1. Seventh seed Jonny Clayton and 2018 champion Rob Cross are among the players in action on Monday as the second round concludes. The third round will start on Friday after a three-day break for Christmas.\n",

In a post on Instagram, Mount said: \"Words can't portray how devastated I'm feeling right now. \"You could probably see the look on my face when it happened.

Asked whether Mount is injury prone, Amorim added: \"That is not my department. \"What I can do is help Mase to teach him to play our game while he is recovering, to give him that time to think about different things. \"With Mason Mount, we are going to help him and it is really hard for him to be out so long.

      "\n",
      "Jack Draper has reached a career high of 15th in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "British number one Jack Draper will miss the first event of the 2025 season with a hip injury but is \"very positive\" about competing at the Australian Open. The 22-year-old cancelled a training camp with four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz in Spain this week because of a \"little bit of a niggle\". Draper says he has now been advised not to play for Great Britain in the United Cup team competition - starting against Argentina in Sydney on 30 December - and will also sit out the Davis Cup tie in Japan in late January. The Australian Open starts in Melbourne on 12 January. \"As I work to get on top of my hip injury and get match fit, I have unfortunately been advised not to play in the United Cup,\" he said in a message posted on his social media channels. \"While we are very positive about competing in the Australian Open this year, I know I won't be able to jump straight into a packed schedule as I manage and strengthen my hip. \"I'm gutted as I was really looking forward to playing in the United Cup for the first time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Draper has risen to number 15 in the world after winning ATP titles in Stuttgart and Vienna and reaching the semi-finals of the US Open in a breakout 2024 season. He will now spend Christmas in the UK before flying to Melbourne at the end of the month. He is not expected to play any events leading into the Australian Open. \"Together with [captain] Leon [Smith], we have also made the difficult decision for me to sit out the upcoming Davis Cup match in Japan in order to give me the opportunity post-Australian Open to complete the rehab and strengthening of my hip,\" he added. That could open the door for 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley to make his Davis Cup debut in his first full year on tour. In the absence of Draper, Fearnley - the world number 99 after a rapid rise up the ATP rankings this year - would be the second highest-ranked British singles player available. Cameron Norrie, ranked 49th in the world, could also make his return to the squad after missing September's round-robin event, where Britain were unable to secure a place in November's knockout stage.\u001b[00m\n"

      "The club is now working with the council to improve its standards\n",
      "\n",
      "The discovery of mouse droppings at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium has led inspectors to downgrade the football club's food hygiene rating. Though no droppings were found in the actual kitchens, a council environmental health officer slashed the club's rating down from four to two out of five, following a visit in November. The club said a \"robust pest-control system\" was in place at the ground and included \"multiple weekly checks\" of all catering areas. Trafford Council said it was working closely with the club so \"necessary improvements\" were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Food Standards Agency rating scheme ranges from 0 (urgent improvement necessary) to 5 (very good). Manchester United's new score has seen it re-rated from good to \"some improvement is necessary\". About 250,000 people each season dine at Old Trafford on food prepared at the ground, according to the club. The club's pest-control teams were contacted soon after the rodents' droppings were discovered. \"If incidences of this nature do occur, immediate and appropriate action is taken,\" the club said. The downgrade comes amid wider discussions about a new stadium for Manchester United, with the club expected to reveal its plans next year.\n",

      "\n",
      "England won Euro 2022 on home soil beating Germany in the final at Wembley\n",
      "\n",
      "Uefa is \"not worried\" that some Women's Euro 2025 matches will clash with the Fifa men's Club World Cup, says managing director Nadine Kessler. Fifa's new expanded men's tournament takes place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July and involves 32 teams, including Chelsea and Manchester City. Switzerland is hosting Euro 2025 from 2-27 July, meaning five or six matches are likely to be played at the same time as some in the men's competition. \"Overall, I'm not really worried. We're talking about two tournaments, in two different countries, with two different timezones,\" said Kessler.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are also broadcasting agreements in place that differs from ours. Again, I'm not worried. \"As much as we always try to get full exclusivity for our women's football tournaments, in the times we live in, with our men's football tournaments having so many in a year, to get that privilege of full exclusivity is not easy any more. \"We must also stick to our plan because I think it's important we get a professional, respected international calendar in place for women's football. We have to co-exist.\" In May, Fifa rejected claims that Fifpro and the World Leagues Association were not consulted over its plans for the Club World Cup. BBC Sport asked Fifa to justify the scheduling clash with Euro 2025 this month. A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: \"The international match calendar for 2025-2030 was approved by the Fifa Council in 2023, which is made up of members from each of the six confederations, including Uefa. \"While Fifa accepts that both the men's and women's international match calendars are constrained by obvious limitations, this was deemed to be the most balanced solution.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Uefa is aiming to sell out all matches at Euro 2025 and make it the most watched women's European football tournament. It has a target for a total attendance of more than 700,000. A portion of tickets went on sale on 1 October and over 200,000 have been sold. St Jakob Park in Basel will host the final with a capacity of 34,050. Uefa's events chief executive Martin Kallen said the tournament is getting \"bigger and bigger\" and this may be the last chance for such a small nation to host the Women's Euros. \"It's already at the edge for Switzerland to be able to do this Euros. I think they waited for the right moment to ask for it,\" said Kallen. \"They got it because in the future I think the stadiums and infrastructure in Switzerland is too small.\" The draw takes place on Monday, 16 December, when defending champions England and tournament debutants Wales will find out their group-stage opponents. Among Uefa's key objectives is an aim to meet \"men's Euros standards\" in terms of team facilities, football technology and analysis. Video assistant referee, goalline technology and semi-automated offsides will all be included. Artificial pitches in Bern and Thun will be overlaid with natural grass in June for the duration of the tournament in order to ensure conditions are the same across all venues. These pitches will be retained until September.\n",

      "Two-time champion Gary Anderson has been dumped out of the PDC World Championship on his 54th birthday by Jeffrey de Graaf. The Scot, winner in 2015 and 2016, lost 3-0 to the Swede in a second-round shock at Alexandra Palace in London. \"Gary didn't really show up as he usually does. I'm very happy with the win,\" said De Graaf, 34, who had a 75% checkout success and began with an 11-dart finish. \"It's a dream come true for me. He's been my idol since I was 14 years old.\" Anderson, ranked 14th, became the 11th seed to be knocked out from the 24 who have played so far, and the fifth to fall on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came into the competition with the year's highest overall three-dart average of 99.66 but hit just three of his 20 checkout attempts to lose his opening match of the tournament for the first time. De Graaf will now meet Filipino qualifier Paolo Nebrida after he stunned England's Ross Smith, the 19th seed, in straight sets. Ritchie Edhouse, Dirk van Duijvenbode and Martin Schindler were the other seeds beaten on day eight. England's Callan Rydz, who hit a record first-round average of 107.06 on Thursday, followed up with a 3-0 win over 23rd seed Schindler on Sunday. The German missed double 12 for a nine-darter in the first set – the third player to do so in 24 hours after Luke Littler and Damon Heta – and ended up losing the leg. Rydz next meets Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, who hit six 180s and averaged 96 in a 3-0 win over Irishman Dylan Slevin.\n",
      "\n",
      "England's Joe Cullen abruptly left his post-match news conference and accused the media of not showing him respect after his 3-0 win over Dutchman Wessel Nijman. Nijman, who has previously served a ban for breaching betting and anti-corruption rules, had been billed as favourite beforehand to beat 23rd seed Cullen. \"Honestly, the media attention that Wessel's got, again this is not a reflection on him,\" Cullen said. \"He seems like a fantastic kid, he's been caught up in a few things beforehand, but he's served his time and he's held his hands up, like a lot haven't. \"I think the way I've been treated probably with the media and things like that - I know you guys have no control over the bookies - I've been shown no respect, so I won't be showing any respect to any of you guys tonight. \"I'm going to go home. Cheers.\" Ian 'Diamond' White beat European champion and 29th seed Edhouse 3-1 and will face teenage star Littler in the next round. White, born in the same Cheshire town as the 17-year-old, acknowledged he would need to up his game in round three. Asked if he knew who was waiting for him, White joked: \"Yeah, Runcorn's number two. I'm from Runcorn and I'm number one.\" Ryan Searle started Sunday afternoon's action off with a 10-dart leg and went on to beat Matt Campbell 3-0, while Latvian Madars Razma defeated 25th seed Van Duijvenbode 3-1. Seventh seed Jonny Clayton and 2018 champion Rob Cross are among the players in action on Monday as the second round concludes.

      "'Life is not easy' - Haaland penalty miss sums up Man City crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has now missed two of his 17 penalties taken in the Premier League\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing seems to be going Manchester City's way at the moment - and star striker Erling Haaland is not a happy man. If there was any player currently in the Premier League you would hand the ball to for a penalty to win a match, it would be the prolific Norwegian. Not on this occasion, though. Looking to land a knockout blow, Haaland saw his second-half strike saved by spot-kick expert Jordan Pickford, as Manchester City's crisis continued with a 1-1 draw against Everton at Etihad Stadium. \"How do you react mentally?\" asked boss Pep Guardiola about the penalty miss. \"Life is not easy. Sport is not easy. When it happens, it is OK. \"There are still a lot of minutes to play and we had the chances afterwards. We created, incredible how they ran and fight. In some games it was not good but today well played.\" At the full-time whistle, there were a smattering of boos from home supporters at Etihad Stadium and a despondent Haaland ripped off his hair bobble and shirt before heading straight down the tunnel. As Haaland trudged off out of sight, Guardiola stood motionless on the pitch with the look of a man unable to find answers to their current crisis. City's all-conquering side have suffered a remarkable drop-off and now won just once in their last 13 games in all competitions. In the post-match news conference, the stunned Spaniard was barely audible in the responses to the questions fired his way. \"My body language was positive,\" he uttered. \"The team played really good. We had I don't know how many shots. The first half was brilliant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "City have a lengthy injury list, but their downturn has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal. The striker made a blistering start to the campaign looked to be on his way to setting more goalscoring records when netting 10 goals in his first five games, but has only managed three in 13 since. This has largely been down to underperformance on his expected goal (xG) rate, with statistics showing he has scored five fewer goals than he should have done during this recent run. There is also a stark contrast from his shot conversion rate from the first five games to his last 13, dropping from 38.5% to a lowly 6.4%. The penalty miss was Haaland's only shot on target in the contest - but Everton did not set out to pay him extra attention. Asked if there had been a special plan to handle the frontman, Dyche said: \"No. I was asked the other day when playing Chelsea about Cole Palmer and what a great player he is turning out to be. \"We know Haaland is too but I believe in the team. I don't look at one aspect of it, I look at the team, what they are doing and they have done a good job today.\"\n",

      "Pickford saved his seventh penalty in the Premier League since joining Everton in 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "After Toffees forward Iliman Ndiaye had cancelled out Bernardo Silva's opener, the defining moment came in the second half when Vitalii Mykolenko tripped Savinho in the box. During the VAR check, it was a battle of the minds with Everton captain Seamus Coleman receiving a yellow card for trying to put off Haaland, who had the ball in his hand. The booking ultimately appeared to be a well-earned one for the team and Pickford seemed to revel in his big moment, jumping up and down on his line, sticking his tongue out before stooping low to his right to push the ball away. Pickford has made big penalty saves for England on the international stage and this was seventh spot-kick stop since joining Everton in 2017. Such is City's luck at the moment that they managed to recycle the ball and Haaland headed in, but it was ruled out for offside, much to the joy of the travelling supporters. Haaland had scored 15 of 16 of his previous penalties in the league, with the other hitting the woodwork, while this was the first he had seen saved. \"It is good from the analysts to give him as much benefit of as many penalties as they can,\" Dyche said of Pickford's save. \"Credit to him for making the right decision in the spur of the moment.\" Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Pickford is good at putting pressure on strikers. Haaland must have felt the pressure there, this place went silent. \"It was a decent save but a really poor penalty. He didn't whip it around like a left-footer should. A poor penalty, but a good save.\" Ex-England defender Matt Upson added on Amazon Prime: \"It was brilliant save from Pickford. He relishes situations like this. He doesn't make life any easier for the penalty taker. \"But for Haaland to miss that penalty speaks a bit about where the confidence is in this team at the moment.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Jack Draper has reached a career high of 15th in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "British number one Jack Draper will miss the first event of the 2025 season with a hip injury but is \"very positive\" about competing at the Australian Open. The 22-year-old cancelled a training camp with four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz in Spain this week because of a \"little bit of a niggle\". Draper says he has now been advised not to play for Great Britain in the United Cup team competition - starting against Argentina in Sydney on 30 December - and will also sit out the Davis Cup tie in Japan in late January. The Australian Open starts in Melbourne on 12 January. \"As I work to get on top of my hip injury and get match fit, I have unfortunately been advised not to play in the United Cup,\" he said in a message posted on his social media channels. \"While we are very positive about competing in the Australian Open this year, I know I won't be able to jump straight into a packed schedule as I manage and strengthen my hip. \"I'm gutted as I was really looking forward to playing in the United Cup for the first time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Draper has risen to number 15 in the world after winning ATP titles in Stuttgart and Vienna and reaching the semi-finals of the US Open in a breakout 2024 season. He will now spend Christmas in the UK before flying to Melbourne at the end of the month. He is not expected to play any events leading into the Australian Open. \"Together with [captain] Leon [Smith], we have also made the difficult decision for me to sit out the upcoming Davis Cup match in Japan in order to give me the opportunity post-Australian Open to complete the rehab and strengthening of my hip,\" he added. That could open the door for 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley to make his Davis Cup debut in his first full year on tour. In the absence of Draper, Fearnley - the world number 99 after a rapid rise up the ATP rankings this year - would be the second highest-ranked British singles player available. Cameron Norrie, ranked 49th in the world, could also make his return to the squad after missing September's round-robin event, where Britain were unable to secure a place in November's knockout stage.\n",

In a post on Instagram, Mount said: \"Words can't portray how devastated I'm feeling right now. \"You could probably see the look on my face when it happened.

Asked whether Mount is injury prone, Amorim added: \"That is not my department. \"What I can do is help Mase to teach him to play our game while he is recovering, to give him that time to think about different things. \"With Mason Mount, we are going to help him and it is really hard for him to be out so long.

      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou says he loves \"being in the middle of a storm\" and intends to \"double down\" on his principles amid his team's poor run of form. Spurs are 11th in the Premier League and winless in five games in all competitions after a 1-1 draw at Rangers on Thursday left them ninth in the Europa League table. \"I am here, I am in for the fight,\" said Postecoglou. \"I am in a fight, for sure. For better or worse I am not going anywhere at the moment because everything is still in my power and my responsibility. \"I still have a real desire to get us through this stage so that people see what is on the other side. My resolve and determination hasn't wavered one little bit. \"I love being in the middle of a storm when everyone doubts, because I know what it is on the other side if you get through it. My job is to get through it.\" Tottenham will aim to avoid a third straight league defeat when they visit bottom side Southampton on Sunday. A 4-3 defeat at home by London rivals Chelsea last weekend, despite leading 2-0, followed a 1-0 loss at Bournemouth, where Postecoglou confronted discontented supporters. Asked whether he would stick to his guns despite recent criticism, Postecoglou said: \"That is kind of where I sit. That doesn't mean I'm inflexible and you don't make slight adjustments, but in tough times you double down on your principles because if you get through there's nothing to fear ahead of you.\" Despite the club's injury concerns, Postecoglou added it would not be \"healthy\" to deviate from his long-term vision and dial down the intensity he expects his team to play with. \"It's a fine line. How much do you dilute for the situation you're in?\" added the Spurs boss. \"I always think, 'what's the long-term effect of it?' It may relieve some short-term pain but if that means people lose belief and conviction in what we're trying to do, because we have found an alternative path that alleviates that short-term stuff, I don't think that's healthy and gets us where we want to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The draw at Rangers left Postecoglu's side with only one win in eight games in all competitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Postecoglou also insisted he is not going to worry about the \"bruised egos\" of players after saying Timo Werner's performance \"wasn't acceptable\" in Thursday's draw at Rangers. Werner, 28, was substituted at half-time after losing possession 16 times, not winning any of his five duels and only completing 69% of his passes. The German forward's replacement, Dejan Kulusevski, scored Spurs' equaliser in the 75th minute at Ibrox. Postecoglou said he did not regret criticising Werner in public because his views were \"an assessment\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Chelsea player Werner, who is on loan from RB Leipzig, has only scored once in 19 appearances for Tottenham. \"Criticism is saying something that's not really helpful,\" added Postecoglou. \"Assessment is trying to give people feedback to try to make them better and give people the opportunity to improve. \"With Timo, it wasn't about whether he played well or not. It was a difficult game. I'm asking 18-year-olds to do difficult jobs. He's an international, he's won the Champions League, he's a senior player. There's a level of application you need to rise to, to raise the team. He didn't reach that. \"Timo is not where our season is at. It's not about Timo. It's not about bringing somebody down and blaming somebody.\" Spurs travel to Southampton on Sunday (19:00 GMT) with limited attacking options as both Richarlison and Wilson Odobert remain sidelined. Postecoglou admitted his side face a \"great challenge\", but wanted players \"who are up for that challenge\". \"We're in a fight here. I'm not going to go away worrying about people's bruised egos,\" added the Australian. \"We're here to win things. If there's somebody in the dressing room who's fit, who feels he needs something extra in this moment, he's probably not the right type.\" What do you make of Postecoglou's comments?

Uefa's events chief executive Martin Kallen said the tournament is getting \"bigger and bigger\" and this may be the last chance for such a small nation to host the Women's Euros. \"It's already at the edge for Switzerland to be able to do this Euros. I think they waited for the right moment to ask for it,\" said Kallen. \"They got it because in the future I think the stadiums and infrastructure in Switzerland is too small.\" The draw takes place on Monday, 16 December, when defending champions England and tournament debutants Wales will find out their group-stage opponents. Among Uefa's key objectives is an aim to meet \"men's Euros standards\" in terms of team facilities, football technology and analysis. Video assistant referee, goalline technology and semi-automated offsides will all be included. Artificial pitches in Bern and Thun will be overlaid with natural grass in June for the duration of the tournament in order to ensure conditions are the same across all venues. These pitches will be retained until September.\n",

      "\n",
      "The discovery of mouse droppings at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium has led inspectors to downgrade the football club's food hygiene rating. Though no droppings were found in the actual kitchens, a council environmental health officer slashed the club's rating down from four to two out of five, following a visit in November. The club said a \"robust pest-control system\" was in place at the ground and included \"multiple weekly checks\" of all catering areas. Trafford Council said it was working closely with the club so \"necessary improvements\" were made.\n",

      "The Food Standards Agency rating scheme ranges from 0 (urgent improvement necessary) to 5 (very good). Manchester United's new score has seen it re-rated from good to \"some improvement is necessary\". About 250,000 people each season dine at Old Trafford on food prepared at the ground, according to the club. The club's pest-control teams were contacted soon after the rodents' droppings were discovered. \"If incidences of this nature do occur, immediate and appropriate action is taken,\" the club said. The downgrade comes amid wider discussions about a new stadium for Manchester United, with the club expected to reveal its plans next year.\n",

      "\n",
      "Two-time champion Gary Anderson has been dumped out of the PDC World Championship on his 54th birthday by Jeffrey de Graaf. The Scot, winner in 2015 and 2016, lost 3-0 to the Swede in a second-round shock at Alexandra Palace in London. \"Gary didn't really show up as he usually does. I'm very happy with the win,\" said De Graaf, 34, who had a 75% checkout success and began with an 11-dart finish. \"It's a dream come true for me. He's been my idol since I was 14 years old.\" Anderson, ranked 14th, became the 11th seed to be knocked out from the 24 who have played so far, and the fifth to fall on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came into the competition with the year's highest overall three-dart average of 99.66 but hit just three of his 20 checkout attempts to lose his opening match of the tournament for the first time. De Graaf will now meet Filipino qualifier Paolo Nebrida after he stunned England's Ross Smith, the 19th seed, in straight sets. Ritchie Edhouse, Dirk van Duijvenbode and Martin Schindler were the other seeds beaten on day eight. England's Callan Rydz, who hit a record first-round average of 107.06 on Thursday, followed up with a 3-0 win over 23rd seed Schindler on Sunday. The German missed double 12 for a nine-darter in the first set – the third player to do so in 24 hours after Luke Littler and Damon Heta – and ended up losing the leg. Rydz next meets Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, who hit six 180s and averaged 96 in a 3-0 win over Irishman Dylan Slevin.\n",
      "\n",
      "England's Joe Cullen abruptly left his post-match news conference and accused the media of not showing him respect after his 3-0 win over Dutchman Wessel Nijman. Nijman, who has previously served a ban for breaching betting and anti-corruption rules, had been billed as favourite beforehand to beat 23rd seed Cullen. \"Honestly, the media attention that Wessel's got, again this is not a reflection on him,\" Cullen said. \"He seems like a fantastic kid, he's been caught up in a few things beforehand, but he's served his time and he's held his hands up, like a lot haven't. \"I think the way I've been treated probably with the media and things like that - I know you guys have no control over the bookies - I've been shown no respect, so I won't be showing any respect to any of you guys tonight. \"I'm going to go home. Cheers.\" Ian 'Diamond' White beat European champion and 29th seed Edhouse 3-1 and will face teenage star Littler in the next round. White, born in the same Cheshire town as the 17-year-old, acknowledged he would need to up his game in round three. Asked if he knew who was waiting for him, White joked: \"Yeah, Runcorn's number two. I'm from Runcorn and I'm number one.\" Ryan Searle started Sunday afternoon's action off with a 10-dart leg and went on to beat Matt Campbell 3-0, while Latvian Madars Razma defeated 25th seed Van Duijvenbode 3-1. Seventh seed Jonny Clayton and 2018 champion Rob Cross are among the players in action on Monday as the second round concludes. The third round will start on Friday after a three-day break for Christmas.\n",

      "'Life is not easy' - Haaland penalty miss sums up Man City crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has now missed two of his 17 penalties taken in the Premier League\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing seems to be going Manchester City's way at the moment - and star striker Erling Haaland is not a happy man. If there was any player currently in the Premier League you would hand the ball to for a penalty to win a match, it would be the prolific Norwegian. Not on this occasion, though. Looking to land a knockout blow, Haaland saw his second-half strike saved by spot-kick expert Jordan Pickford, as Manchester City's crisis continued with a 1-1 draw against Everton at Etihad Stadium. \"How do you react mentally?\" asked boss Pep Guardiola about the penalty miss. \"Life is not easy. Sport is not easy. When it happens, it is OK. \"There are still a lot of minutes to play and we had the chances afterwards. We created, incredible how they ran and fight. In some games it was not good but today well played.\" At the full-time whistle, there were a smattering of boos from home supporters at Etihad Stadium and a despondent Haaland ripped off his hair bobble and shirt before heading straight down the tunnel. As Haaland trudged off out of sight, Guardiola stood motionless on the pitch with the look of a man unable to find answers to their current crisis. City's all-conquering side have suffered a remarkable drop-off and now won just once in their last 13 games in all competitions. In the post-match news conference, the stunned Spaniard was barely audible in the responses to the questions fired his way. \"My body language was positive,\" he uttered. \"The team played really good. We had I don't know how many shots. The first half was brilliant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "City have a lengthy injury list, but their downturn has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal. The striker made a blistering start to the campaign looked to be on his way to setting more goalscoring records when netting 10 goals in his first five games, but has only managed three in 13 since. This has largely been down to underperformance on his expected goal (xG) rate, with statistics showing he has scored five fewer goals than he should have done during this recent run. There is also a stark contrast from his shot conversion rate from the first five games to his last 13, dropping from 38.5% to a lowly 6.4%. The penalty miss was Haaland's only shot on target in the contest - but Everton did not set out to pay him extra attention. Asked if there had been a special plan to handle the frontman, Dyche said: \"No. I was asked the other day when playing Chelsea about Cole Palmer and what a great player he is turning out to be. \"We know Haaland is too but I believe in the team. I don't look at one aspect of it, I look at the team, what they are doing and they have done a good job today.\"\n",

      "Pickford saved his seventh penalty in the Premier League since joining Everton in 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "After Toffees forward Iliman Ndiaye had cancelled out Bernardo Silva's opener, the defining moment came in the second half when Vitalii Mykolenko tripped Savinho in the box. During the VAR check, it was a battle of the minds with Everton captain Seamus Coleman receiving a yellow card for trying to put off Haaland, who had the ball in his hand. The booking ultimately appeared to be a well-earned one for the team and Pickford seemed to revel in his big moment, jumping up and down on his line, sticking his tongue out before stooping low to his right to push the ball away. Pickford has made big penalty saves for England on the international stage and this was seventh spot-kick stop since joining Everton in 2017. Such is City's luck at the moment that they managed to recycle the ball and Haaland headed in, but it was ruled out for offside, much to the joy of the travelling supporters. Haaland had scored 15 of 16 of his previous penalties in the league, with the other hitting the woodwork, while this was the first he had seen saved. \"It is good from the analysts to give him as much benefit of as many penalties as they can,\" Dyche said of Pickford's save. \"Credit to him for making the right decision in the spur of the moment.\" Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Pickford is good at putting pressure on strikers. Haaland must have felt the pressure there, this place went silent. \"It was a decent save but a really poor penalty. He didn't whip it around like a left-footer should. A poor penalty, but a good save.\" Ex-England defender Matt Upson added on Amazon Prime: \"It was brilliant save from Pickford. He relishes situations like this. He doesn't make life any easier for the penalty taker. \"But for Haaland to miss that penalty speaks a bit about where the confidence is in this team at the moment.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Jack Draper has reached a career high of 15th in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "British number one Jack Draper will miss the first event of the 2025 season with a hip injury but is \"very positive\" about competing at the Australian Open. The 22-year-old cancelled a training camp with four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz in Spain this week because of a \"little bit of a niggle\". Draper says he has now been advised not to play for Great Britain in the United Cup team competition - starting against Argentina in Sydney on 30 December - and will also sit out the Davis Cup tie in Japan in late January. The Australian Open starts in Melbourne on 12 January. \"As I work to get on top of my hip injury and get match fit, I have unfortunately been advised not to play in the United Cup,\" he said in a message posted on his social media channels. \"While we are very positive about competing in the Australian Open this year, I know I won't be able to jump straight into a packed schedule as I manage and strengthen my hip. \"I'm gutted as I was really looking forward to playing in the United Cup for the first time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Draper has risen to number 15 in the world after winning ATP titles in Stuttgart and Vienna and reaching the semi-finals of the US Open in a breakout 2024 season. He will now spend Christmas in the UK before flying to Melbourne at the end of the month. He is not expected to play any events leading into the Australian Open. \"Together with [captain] Leon [Smith], we have also made the difficult decision for me to sit out the upcoming Davis Cup match in Japan in order to give me the opportunity post-Australian Open to complete the rehab and strengthening of my hip,\" he added. That could open the door for 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley to make his Davis Cup debut in his first full year on tour. In the absence of Draper, Fearnley - the world number 99 after a rapid rise up the ATP rankings this year - would be the second highest-ranked British singles player available. Cameron Norrie, ranked 49th in the world, could also make his return to the squad after missing September's round-robin event, where Britain were unable to secure a place in November's knockout stage.\n",

      "Manchester United forward Mason Mount says he is \"devastated\" after being ruled out for \"several weeks\" with a leg injury. The England international was forced off just 14 minutes into Sunday's Manchester derby win at neighbours City. In a post on Instagram, Mount said: \"Words can't portray how devastated I'm feeling right now. \"You could probably see the look on my face when it happened. I knew what it meant.\" Speaking after United's Carabao Cup defeat at Tottenham about Mount's expected absence, Amorim said: \"I don't know the exact date but it is going to be long.\" Mount was making just his fourth Premier League start of the season.

Asked whether Mount is injury prone, Amorim added: \"That is not my department. \"What I can do is help Mase to teach him to play our game while he is recovering, to give him that time to think about different things. \"With Mason Mount, we are going to help him and it is really hard for him to be out so long.

      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou says he loves \"being in the middle of a storm\" and intends to \"double down\" on his principles amid his team's poor run of form. Spurs are 11th in the Premier League and winless in five games in all competitions after a 1-1 draw at Rangers on Thursday left them ninth in the Europa League table. \"I am here, I am in for the fight,\" said Postecoglou. \"I am in a fight, for sure. For better or worse I am not going anywhere at the moment because everything is still in my power and my responsibility. \"I still have a real desire to get us through this stage so that people see what is on the other side. My resolve and determination hasn't wavered one little bit. \"I love being in the middle of a storm when everyone doubts, because I know what it is on the other side if you get through it. My job is to get through it.\" Tottenham will aim to avoid a third straight league defeat when they visit bottom side Southampton on Sunday. A 4-3 defeat at home by London rivals Chelsea last weekend, despite leading 2-0, followed a 1-0 loss at Bournemouth, where Postecoglou confronted discontented supporters. Asked whether he would stick to his guns despite recent criticism, Postecoglou said: \"That is kind of where I sit. That doesn't mean I'm inflexible and you don't make slight adjustments, but in tough times you double down on your principles because if you get through there's nothing to fear ahead of you.\" Despite the club's injury concerns, Postecoglou added it would not be \"healthy\" to deviate from his long-term vision and dial down the intensity he expects his team to play with. \"It's a fine line. How much do you dilute for the situation you're in?\" added the Spurs boss. \"I always think, 'what's the long-term effect of it?' It may relieve some short-term pain but if that means people lose belief and conviction in what we're trying to do, because we have found an alternative path that alleviates that short-term stuff, I don't think that's healthy and gets us where we want to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The draw at Rangers left Postecoglu's side with only one win in eight games in all competitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Postecoglou also insisted he is not going to worry about the \"bruised egos\" of players after saying Timo Werner's performance \"wasn't acceptable\" in Thursday's draw at Rangers. Werner, 28, was substituted at half-time after losing possession 16 times, not winning any of his five duels and only completing 69% of his passes. The German forward's replacement, Dejan Kulusevski, scored Spurs' equaliser in the 75th minute at Ibrox. Postecoglou said he did not regret criticising Werner in public because his views were \"an assessment\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Chelsea player Werner, who is on loan from RB Leipzig, has only scored once in 19 appearances for Tottenham. \"Criticism is saying something that's not really helpful,\" added Postecoglou. \"Assessment is trying to give people feedback to try to make them better and give people the opportunity to improve. \"With Timo, it wasn't about whether he played well or not. It was a difficult game. I'm asking 18-year-olds to do difficult jobs. He's an international, he's won the Champions League, he's a senior player. There's a level of application you need to rise to, to raise the team. He didn't reach that. \"Timo is not where our season is at. It's not about Timo. It's not about bringing somebody down and blaming somebody.\" Spurs travel to Southampton on Sunday (19:00 GMT) with limited attacking options as both Richarlison and Wilson Odobert remain sidelined. Postecoglou admitted his side face a \"great challenge\", but wanted players \"who are up for that challenge\". \"We're in a fight here. I'm not going to go away worrying about people's bruised egos,\" added the Australian. \"We're here to win things. If there's somebody in the dressing room who's fit, who feels he needs something extra in this moment, he's probably not the right type.\" What do you make of Postecoglou's comments?

Fifa's new expanded men's tournament takes place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July and involves 32 teams, including Chelsea and Manchester City. Switzerland is hosting Euro 2025 from 2-27 July, meaning five or six matches are likely to be played at the same time as some in the men's competition. \"Overall, I'm not really worried.

      "Uefa is aiming to sell out all matches at Euro 2025 and make it the most watched women's European football tournament. It has a target for a total attendance of more than 700,000. A portion of tickets went on sale on 1 October and over 200,000 have been sold. St Jakob Park in Basel will host the final with a capacity of 34,050. Uefa's events chief executive Martin Kallen said the tournament is getting \"bigger and bigger\" and this may be the last chance for such a small nation to host the Women's Euros. \"It's already at the edge for Switzerland to be able to do this Euros. I think they waited for the right moment to ask for it,\" said Kallen. \"They got it because in the future I think the stadiums and infrastructure in Switzerland is too small.\" The draw takes place on Monday, 16 December, when defending champions England and tournament debutants Wales will find out their group-stage opponents. Among Uefa's key objectives is an aim to meet \"men's Euros standards\" in terms of team facilities, football technology and analysis. Video assistant referee, goalline technology and semi-automated offsides will all be included. Artificial pitches in Bern and Thun will be overlaid with natural grass in June for the duration of the tournament in order to ensure conditions are the same across all venues. These pitches will be retained until September.\n",

      "'Life is not easy' - Haaland penalty miss sums up Man City crisis\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has now missed two of his 17 penalties taken in the Premier League\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing seems to be going Manchester City's way at the moment - and star striker Erling Haaland is not a happy man. If there was any player currently in the Premier League you would hand the ball to for a penalty to win a match, it would be the prolific Norwegian. Not on this occasion, though. Looking to land a knockout blow, Haaland saw his second-half strike saved by spot-kick expert Jordan Pickford, as Manchester City's crisis continued with a 1-1 draw against Everton at Etihad Stadium. \"How do you react mentally?\" asked boss Pep Guardiola about the penalty miss. \"Life is not easy. Sport is not easy. When it happens, it is OK. \"There are still a lot of minutes to play and we had the chances afterwards. We created, incredible how they ran and fight. In some games it was not good but today well played.\" At the full-time whistle, there were a smattering of boos from home supporters at Etihad Stadium and a despondent Haaland ripped off his hair bobble and shirt before heading straight down the tunnel. As Haaland trudged off out of sight, Guardiola stood motionless on the pitch with the look of a man unable to find answers to their current crisis. City's all-conquering side have suffered a remarkable drop-off and now won just once in their last 13 games in all competitions. In the post-match news conference, the stunned Spaniard was barely audible in the responses to the questions fired his way. \"My body language was positive,\" he uttered. \"The team played really good. We had I don't know how many shots. The first half was brilliant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "City have a lengthy injury list, but their downturn has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal. The striker made a blistering start to the campaign looked to be on his way to setting more goalscoring records when netting 10 goals in his first five games, but has only managed three in 13 since. This has largely been down to underperformance on his expected goal (xG) rate, with statistics showing he has scored five fewer goals than he should have done during this recent run. There is also a stark contrast from his shot conversion rate from the first five games to his last 13, dropping from 38.5% to a lowly 6.4%. The penalty miss was Haaland's only shot on target in the contest - but Everton did not set out to pay him extra attention. Asked if there had been a special plan to handle the frontman, Dyche said: \"No. I was asked the other day when playing Chelsea about Cole Palmer and what a great player he is turning out to be. \"We know Haaland is too but I believe in the team. I don't look at one aspect of it, I look at the team, what they are doing and they have done a good job today.\"\n",

      "Pickford saved his seventh penalty in the Premier League since joining Everton in 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "After Toffees forward Iliman Ndiaye had cancelled out Bernardo Silva's opener, the defining moment came in the second half when Vitalii Mykolenko tripped Savinho in the box. During the VAR check, it was a battle of the minds with Everton captain Seamus Coleman receiving a yellow card for trying to put off Haaland, who had the ball in his hand. The booking ultimately appeared to be a well-earned one for the team and Pickford seemed to revel in his big moment, jumping up and down on his line, sticking his tongue out before stooping low to his right to push the ball away. Pickford has made big penalty saves for England on the international stage and this was seventh spot-kick stop since joining Everton in 2017. Such is City's luck at the moment that they managed to recycle the ball and Haaland headed in, but it was ruled out for offside, much to the joy of the travelling supporters. Haaland had scored 15 of 16 of his previous penalties in the league, with the other hitting the woodwork, while this was the first he had seen saved. \"It is good from the analysts to give him as much benefit of as many penalties as they can,\" Dyche said of Pickford's save. \"Credit to him for making the right decision in the spur of the moment.\" Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Pickford is good at putting pressure on strikers. Haaland must have felt the pressure there, this place went silent. \"It was a decent save but a really poor penalty. He didn't whip it around like a left-footer should. A poor penalty, but a good save.\" Ex-England defender Matt Upson added on Amazon Prime: \"It was brilliant save from Pickford. He relishes situations like this. He doesn't make life any easier for the penalty taker. \"But for Haaland to miss that penalty speaks a bit about where the confidence is in this team at the moment.\"\n",

      "Gary Anderson was the fifth seed to be beaten on Sunday\n",
      "\n",
      "Two-time champion Gary Anderson has been dumped out of the PDC World Championship on his 54th birthday by Jeffrey de Graaf. The Scot, winner in 2015 and 2016, lost 3-0 to the Swede in a second-round shock at Alexandra Palace in London. \"Gary didn't really show up as he usually does. I'm very happy with the win,\" said De Graaf, 34, who had a 75% checkout success and began with an 11-dart finish. \"It's a dream come true for me. He's been my idol since I was 14 years old.\" Anderson, ranked 14th, became the 11th seed to be knocked out from the 24 who have played so far, and the fifth to fall on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came into the competition with the year's highest overall three-dart average of 99.66 but hit just three of his 20 checkout attempts to lose his opening match of the tournament for the first time. De Graaf will now meet Filipino qualifier Paolo Nebrida after he stunned England's Ross Smith, the 19th seed, in straight sets. Ritchie Edhouse, Dirk van Duijvenbode and Martin Schindler were the other seeds beaten on day eight. England's Callan Rydz, who hit a record first-round average of 107.06 on Thursday, followed up with a 3-0 win over 23rd seed Schindler on Sunday. The German missed double 12 for a nine-darter in the first set – the third player to do so in 24 hours after Luke Littler and Damon Heta – and ended up losing the leg. Rydz next meets Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh, who hit six 180s and averaged 96 in a 3-0 win over Irishman Dylan Slevin.\n",
      "\n",
      "England's Joe Cullen abruptly left his post-match news conference and accused the media of not showing him respect after his 3-0 win over Dutchman Wessel Nijman. Nijman, who has previously served a ban for breaching betting and anti-corruption rules, had been billed as favourite beforehand to beat 23rd seed Cullen. \"Honestly, the media attention that Wessel's got, again this is not a reflection on him,\" Cullen said. \"He seems like a fantastic kid, he's been caught up in a few things beforehand, but he's served his time and he's held his hands up, like a lot haven't. \"I think the way I've been treated probably with the media and things like that - I know you guys have no control over the bookies - I've been shown no respect, so I won't be showing any respect to any of you guys tonight. \"I'm going to go home. Cheers.\" Ian 'Diamond' White beat European champion and 29th seed Edhouse 3-1 and will face teenage star Littler in the next round. White, born in the same Cheshire town as the 17-year-old, acknowledged he would need to up his game in round three. Asked if he knew who was waiting for him, White joked: \"Yeah, Runcorn's number two. I'm from Runcorn and I'm number one.\" Ryan Searle started Sunday afternoon's action off with a 10-dart leg and went on to beat Matt Campbell 3-0, while Latvian Madars Razma defeated 25th seed Van Duijvenbode 3-1. Seventh seed Jonny Clayton and 2018 champion Rob Cross are among the players in action on Monday as the second round concludes. The third round will start on Friday after a three-day break for Christmas.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mason Mount has made just nine Premier League starts since joining Manchester United in July 2023\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester United forward Mason Mount says he is \"devastated\" after being ruled out for \"several weeks\" with a leg injury. The England international was forced off just 14 minutes into Sunday's Manchester derby win at neighbours City. In a post on Instagram, Mount said: \"Words can't portray how devastated I'm feeling right now. \"You could probably see the look on my face when it happened. I knew what it meant.\" Speaking after United's Carabao Cup defeat at Tottenham about Mount's expected absence, Amorim said: \"I don't know the exact date but it is going to be long.\" Mount was making just his fourth Premier League start of the season. He started only five matches during his first season with United after joining from Chelsea in July 2023.\n",

Asked whether Mount is injury prone, Amorim added: \"That is not my department. \"What I can do is help Mase to teach him to play our game while he is recovering, to give him that time to think about different things. \"With Mason Mount, we are going to help him and it is really hard for him to be out so long.

      "\n",
      "Jack Draper has reached a career high of 15th in the world\n",
      "\n",
      "British number one Jack Draper will miss the first event of the 2025 season with a hip injury but is \"very positive\" about competing at the Australian Open. The 22-year-old cancelled a training camp with four-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz in Spain this week because of a \"little bit of a niggle\". Draper says he has now been advised not to play for Great Britain in the United Cup team competition - starting against Argentina in Sydney on 30 December - and will also sit out the Davis Cup tie in Japan in late January. The Australian Open starts in Melbourne on 12 January. \"As I work to get on top of my hip injury and get match fit, I have unfortunately been advised not to play in the United Cup,\" he said in a message posted on his social media channels. \"While we are very positive about competing in the Australian Open this year, I know I won't be able to jump straight into a packed schedule as I manage and strengthen my hip. \"I'm gutted as I was really looking forward to playing in the United Cup for the first time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Draper has risen to number 15 in the world after winning ATP titles in Stuttgart and Vienna and reaching the semi-finals of the US Open in a breakout 2024 season. He will now spend Christmas in the UK before flying to Melbourne at the end of the month. He is not expected to play any events leading into the Australian Open. \"Together with [captain] Leon [Smith], we have also made the difficult decision for me to sit out the upcoming Davis Cup match in Japan in order to give me the opportunity post-Australian Open to complete the rehab and strengthening of my hip,\" he added. That could open the door for 23-year-old Jacob Fearnley to make his Davis Cup debut in his first full year on tour. In the absence of Draper, Fearnley - the world number 99 after a rapid rise up the ATP rankings this year - would be the second highest-ranked British singles player available. Cameron Norrie, ranked 49th in the world, could also make his return to the squad after missing September's round-robin event, where Britain were unable to secure a place in November's knockout stage.\n",

      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou says he loves \"being in the middle of a storm\" and intends to \"double down\" on his principles amid his team's poor run of form. Spurs are 11th in the Premier League and winless in five games in all competitions after a 1-1 draw at Rangers on Thursday left them ninth in the Europa League table. \"I am here, I am in for the fight,\" said Postecoglou. \"I am in a fight, for sure. For better or worse I am not going anywhere at the moment because everything is still in my power and my responsibility. \"I still have a real desire to get us through this stage so that people see what is on the other side. My resolve and determination hasn't wavered one little bit. \"I love being in the middle of a storm when everyone doubts, because I know what it is on the other side if you get through it. My job is to get through it.\" Tottenham will aim to avoid a third straight league defeat when they visit bottom side Southampton on Sunday. A 4-3 defeat at home by London rivals Chelsea last weekend, despite leading 2-0, followed a 1-0 loss at Bournemouth, where Postecoglou confronted discontented supporters. Asked whether he would stick to his guns despite recent criticism, Postecoglou said: \"That is kind of where I sit. That doesn't mean I'm inflexible and you don't make slight adjustments, but in tough times you double down on your principles because if you get through there's nothing to fear ahead of you.\" Despite the club's injury concerns, Postecoglou added it would not be \"healthy\" to deviate from his long-term vision and dial down the intensity he expects his team to play with. \"It's a fine line. How much do you dilute for the situation you're in?\" added the Spurs boss. \"I always think, 'what's the long-term effect of it?' It may relieve some short-term pain but if that means people lose belief and conviction in what we're trying to do, because we have found an alternative path that alleviates that short-term stuff, I don't think that's healthy and gets us where we want to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The draw at Rangers left Postecoglu's side with only one win in eight games in all competitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Postecoglou also insisted he is not going to worry about the \"bruised egos\" of players after saying Timo Werner's performance \"wasn't acceptable\" in Thursday's draw at Rangers. Werner, 28, was substituted at half-time after losing possession 16 times, not winning any of his five duels and only completing 69% of his passes. The German forward's replacement, Dejan Kulusevski, scored Spurs' equaliser in the 75th minute at Ibrox. Postecoglou said he did not regret criticising Werner in public because his views were \"an assessment\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Chelsea player Werner, who is on loan from RB Leipzig, has only scored once in 19 appearances for Tottenham. \"Criticism is saying something that's not really helpful,\" added Postecoglou. \"Assessment is trying to give people feedback to try to make them better and give people the opportunity to improve. \"With Timo, it wasn't about whether he played well or not. It was a difficult game. I'm asking 18-year-olds to do difficult jobs. He's an international, he's won the Champions League, he's a senior player. There's a level of application you need to rise to, to raise the team. He didn't reach that. \"Timo is not where our season is at. It's not about Timo. It's not about bringing somebody down and blaming somebody.\" Spurs travel to Southampton on Sunday (19:00 GMT) with limited attacking options as both Richarlison and Wilson Odobert remain sidelined. Postecoglou admitted his side face a \"great challenge\", but wanted players \"who are up for that challenge\". \"We're in a fight here. I'm not going to go away worrying about people's bruised egos,\" added the Australian. \"We're here to win things. If there's somebody in the dressing room who's fit, who feels he needs something extra in this moment, he's probably not the right type.\" What do you make of Postecoglou's comments?
