    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the search engine converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."

      "1. **Agricultural Outputs Affected**:\n",
      "   - The conflict has significantly impacted the production and export of key agricultural products from Ukraine, one of the world's largest grain exporters. This disruption has contributed to global shortages and increased prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Supply Chain Changes**:\n",
      "   - The war has led to significant disruptions in global supply chains, particularly for grains and fertilizers. The closure of ports and transportation routes in Ukraine has hindered the export of essential agricultural commodities, exacerbating global supply chain challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Countries Most Impacted**:\n",
      "   - Countries heavily reliant on Ukrainian grain imports, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, are facing severe food shortages. These regions are experiencing heightened food insecurity due to their dependence on imports from Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Price Fluctuations**:\n",
      "   - Global food prices have risen sharply as a result of the conflict. The disruption in supply chains and increased costs of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, have contributed to these price hikes, affecting consumers worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Long-term Implications**:\n",
      "   - The ongoing conflict poses significant long-term risks to global food security. Prolonged disruptions in agricultural production and exports from Ukraine could lead to sustained food shortages and price volatility, impacting vulnerable populations the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Supporting Evidence**:\n",
      "- The World Food Programme has warned of increased starvation risks due to the conflict.\n",
