    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."
