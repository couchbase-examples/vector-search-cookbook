    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

    "How to run this tutorial\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) that you can run \n",
    "interactively. You can access the original notebook here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either:\n",
    "- Download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
    "- Run it on your system by setting up the Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start\n",
    "---------------\n",

    "1. Create and Deploy Your Free Tier Operational cluster on [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up)\n",
    "   - To get started with [Couchbase Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com), create an account and use it to deploy \n",
    "     a forever free tier operational cluster\n",
    "   - This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn \n",
    "     about Capella with no time constraint\n",
    "   - To learn more, please follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "   When running Couchbase using Capella, the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "   - Create the database credentials to access the required bucket (Read and Write) used in the application\n",
    "   - Allow access to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running by following the [Network Security documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/security/security.html#public-access)"

Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the search engine converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."

      "Man Utd are better with Rashford - Amorim\n",
      "\n",
      "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. I just want to help Marcus - Amorim on Rashford\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim says the club are \"better\" with Marcus Rashford after the forward suggested he could leave Old Trafford. The England international, 27, said on Tuesday that he was \"ready for a new challenge and the next steps\" in his career. It came two days after Rashford was dropped for United's derby win against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium. Rashford's last Premier League start came in a 4-0 win against Everton on 1 December, when he scored twice. Amorim suggested the club want the striker - who came through United's youth ranks - to stay, saying: \"I don't talk about the future, we talk about the present. \"This kind of club needs big talent and he's a big talent, so he just needs to perform at the highest level and that is my focus. I just want to help Marcus.\" Asked about Rashford's desire for a \"new challenge\", Amorim said: \"I think it's right. We have here a new challenge, it's a tough one. \"For me it's the biggest challenge in football because we are in a difficult situation and I already said this is one of the biggest clubs in the world. \"I really hope all my players are ready for this new challenge.\" Amorim added the club will \"try different things\" to help Rashford find the \"best levels he has shown in the past\". \"Nothing has changed - we believe in Marcus,\" said Amorim. \"It's hard to explain to you guys what I am going to do. I'm a little bit emotional so in the moment I will decide what to do. \"It's a hard situation to comment [on]. If I give a lot of importance it will have big headlines in the papers and if I say it's not a problem then my standards are getting low.\" Asked if he, when he was a player, would do an interview or speak privately, Amorim said: \"If this was me probably I would speak with the manager.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Manchester United face Tottenham in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup on Thursday (20:00 GMT). Amorim refused to confirm whether Rashford or winger Alejandro Garnacho - who was also left out of the squad to face Manchester City - would feature against Spurs. However, Rashford was not pictured travelling with the team when they left for London, but Garnacho was. Asked how Garnacho has reacted to being left out, Amorim said: \"Really good - he trained really well. He seems a little bit upset with me and that's perfect. \"I was really, really happy because I would do the same. He's ready for this game.\" One player that will not be available is midfielder Mason Mount, who went off in the 14th minute of Sunday's win. Amorim said his injury was still being assessed and Mount was \"really sad\" in the dressing room, adding \"we need to help him\".\n",
      "• None What happens now with Man Utd and Rashford?\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus Rashford has started three of Manchester United's seven matches since Ruben Amorim was appointed\n",
      "\n",
      "Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for United since his debut in 2016. His most prolific season was 2022-23, when he scored 30 times in 56 games in all competitions and was rewarded with a new five-year deal. Rashford's goals in that campaign account for more than one-fifth (21.7%) of his total tally across nine and a half seasons at Old Trafford. However, he has struggled for form in the past 18 months, with 15 goals in his past 67 appearances. The forward's shot conversion rate was 11.9% in the 2021-22 season, when he scored five goals in 32 matches. That rate increased to 18% the following season when he scored 30 times, but fell to just 9.4% last term - the worst rate of his career across a whole campaign - as he netted eight times in 43 matches. Since 2019-20, United have won 52.7% of their matches in all competitions with Rashford in the starting line-up (107 wins from 203 games), compared to 54.2% without (58 from 107).\n",
      "\n",
      "If Manchester United offered guidance to avoid creating even more turmoil around an already delicate situation, Ruben Amorim has followed it. We already know enough of Amorim to know he will not hold back just for the sake of it, but this is a case where actions will speak louder than words. Amorim says he wants \"big talent\" Rashford to stay. But also that players have to meet his standards. He says Rashford - and Alejandro Garnacho - will be assessed for selection on their training-ground performances. It is fair to assume therefore that if neither reaches the required standard, they will not travel to London for the EFL Cup tie at Tottenham - even if Rashford has shaken off the illness that prevented him from training on Monday. After Tottenham, United have Premier League games against Bournemouth, Wolves and Newcastle. We will know soon enough where Rashford fits in Amorim's plans. If he fails to reach the standards his new boss demands, the 27-year-old will not feature.\u001b[00m\n"
