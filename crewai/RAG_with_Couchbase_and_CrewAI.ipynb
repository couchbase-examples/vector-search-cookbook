    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the search engine converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."

      "1. Stock Market Crash of 1929: The stock market crash in October 1929 is often cited as the immediate trigger of the Great Depression. The crash led to a loss of confidence in the financial system and a reduction in consumer spending and investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Bank Failures: Many banks failed during the early 1930s, leading to a contraction in the money supply. This was partly due to bank runs, where panicked depositors withdrew their funds, causing even solvent banks to collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reduction in Consumer Spending: As people lost their jobs and savings, consumer spending decreased significantly, leading to a decline in production and further job losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. International Trade Issues: The imposition of tariffs, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, led to a decline in international trade. Other countries retaliated with their tariffs, exacerbating the global economic downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy during this period is often criticized for being too tight, which contributed to deflation and worsened the economic situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors, among others, created a downward economic spiral that resulted in the prolonged economic hardship known as the Great Depression.\u001b[00m\n",

      "**The Causes of the 1929 Great Depression: A Comprehensive Analysis**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Great Depression, which began in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s, was the most severe economic downturn in modern history. It had profound effects on both the United States and the global economy, leading to widespread unemployment, poverty, and political upheaval. Understanding the causes of the Great Depression is crucial for comprehending the economic and social dynamics of the early 20th century. This analysis explores the key factors that contributed to the onset of the Great Depression, including the stock market crash, bank failures, reduction in consumer spending, international trade issues, and monetary policy missteps.\n",

      "**a. Stock Market Crash of 1929**\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market crash of October 1929 is often regarded as the immediate trigger of the Great Depression. In the years leading up to the crash, the stock market experienced a speculative bubble, with stock prices soaring to unsustainable levels. On October 24, 1929, known as Black Thursday, panic selling began, and by October 29, Black Tuesday, the market had plummeted. This crash resulted in a massive loss of wealth, eroding consumer confidence and leading to a sharp decline in spending and investment. The crash exposed the vulnerabilities in the financial system and set off a chain reaction that contributed to the economic downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "**b. Bank Failures**\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the stock market crash, the banking sector faced severe challenges. Many banks had invested heavily in the stock market and suffered significant losses. As panic spread, depositors rushed to withdraw their funds, leading to bank runs. Even solvent banks were unable to meet the sudden demand for cash, resulting in widespread bank failures. The collapse of banks led to a contraction in the money supply, further exacerbating the economic crisis. The loss of savings and the inability to access credit stifled economic activity and deepened the depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "**c. Reduction in Consumer Spending**\n",
      "\n",
      "The economic turmoil led to a significant reduction in consumer spending. As people lost their jobs and savings, consumer confidence plummeted. The decline in spending resulted in decreased demand for goods and services, prompting businesses to cut production and lay off workers. This created a vicious cycle of unemployment and reduced income, further diminishing consumer spending and prolonging the economic downturn.\n",
      "\n",
      "**d. International Trade Issues**\n",
      "\n",
      "International trade issues also played a critical role in the Great Depression. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff, enacted in 1930, aimed to protect American industries by imposing high tariffs on imported goods. However, this policy backfired as other countries retaliated with their tariffs, leading to a sharp decline in international trade. The reduction in trade not only affected the U.S. economy but also contributed to a global economic downturn, as countries around the world experienced decreased demand for their exports.\n",
      "\n",
      "**e. Monetary Policy**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Reserve's monetary policy during this period is often criticized for being too restrictive. In an attempt to curb speculation, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which further tightened credit and reduced the money supply. This policy contributed to deflation, making debts more burdensome and reducing consumer and business spending. The failure to provide adequate liquidity to the banking system and the economy at large worsened the economic situation and prolonged the depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Great Depression was the result of a complex interplay of factors, each contributing to a downward economic spiral. The stock market crash undermined financial stability and consumer confidence, while bank failures led to a contraction in the money supply. The reduction in consumer spending and international trade issues further exacerbated the economic decline. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy missteps intensified deflationary pressures. Together, these factors created a prolonged period of economic hardship that reshaped the economic and social landscape of the 20th century. Understanding these causes provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of economic systems and the importance of sound economic policies.\u001b[00m\n",
