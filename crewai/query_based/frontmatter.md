title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with CrewAI using Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index
short_title: RAG with CrewAI using Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index
description: |
  In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial uses Couchbase's **Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index** capabilities, which offer high-performance vector search optimized for large-scale applications. Hyperscale Vector Indexes  are designed for pure vector searches, while Composite Vector Indexes enable filtered searches combining vector similarity with scalar attributes. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the Search Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-crewai-couchbase-rag-with-search-vector-index/)
