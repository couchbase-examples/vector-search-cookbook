title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with CrewAI and Couchbase Search Vector Index
short_title: RAG with CrewAI and Couchbase Search Vector Index
description:
In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-crewai-couchbase-rag-with-hyperscale-or-composite-vector-index/)
