        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and [Anthropic](https://claude.ai/) as the language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

        "# Perform Semantic Search\n",
        "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

            "The DJ and podcaster Fat Tony has said he was left with facial injuries after he was hit at a gig in Kent. Fat Tony, real name Anthony Marnoch, performed on Friday at Lido Margate and said in an Instagram post the following day he had been hurt \"last night at a gig\", while sharing a video of bruising and swelling to his face. Marnoch added he was treated at a hospital's A&E unit but was \"absolutely gutted\" to cancel his Saturday show at London venue No90 Hackney Wick. \"I'm really sorry that I won't be seeing you tonight but we will reschedule everything,\" he added.\n",
            "\n",
            "Marnoch wrote that he was \"under doctors' orders\" to \"rest and get better\", and he would be \"OK\" and is \"on the mend\". \"I really am so sorry,\" he added. \"I will make it up to you all in the new year. Happy Christmas everyone, take care of yourselves.\" The event will be rescheduled for January, he said.\n",

            "TV presenter Davina McCall said: \"This is terrible… Love you so much x (kiss) call (you) tomorrow.\" On Sunday, Marnoch gave an update on his condition saying he was in \"a lot of pain and (his face is) swollen\", as he gave thanks for the \"outpouring of support\". He also said he was at home with his dogs and partner Stavros Agapiou, where he was being \"looked after\". The DJ is a regular feature of red carpets, attending events with reality TV star Gemma Collins and singer and actress Claire Sweeney. In a statement, a Kent Police spokesman said: \"(It) is investigating the report of an assault at the Lido Leisure Centre in Ethelbert Terrace, Margate. \"It is alleged a man in his 50s was working as a DJ at the premises when he was assaulted by another man between 1.15am and 1.37am on Saturday 14 December 2024. \"Patrols and paramedics attended the scene and the victim was treated for facial injuries. He subsequently went to hospital for further medical attention.\"\n",

        "Couchbase and LangChain can be seamlessly integrated to create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chains, enhancing the process of generating contextually relevant responses. In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a generative language model within LangChain.\n",
        "\n",
        "The language model, equipped with the context from the retrieved documents, generates a response that is both informed and contextually accurate. This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase’s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while LangChain handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation."

        "# Using Couchbase as a caching mechanism\n",
        "Couchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "For subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.\n"
