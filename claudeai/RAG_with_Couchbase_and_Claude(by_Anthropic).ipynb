        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and [Anthropic](https://claude.ai/) as the language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches.

Insiders have told the BBC that discussions involving the FA's board remain ongoing. It has been suggested that rather than a traditional vote, ratification might instead be confirmed by acclamation - with federations in favour asked to show their support by applauding. However, Fifa is yet to confirm this, and FA officials have sought clarification on the process. On Friday, the DFB - Germany's national football association - announced it would vote in favour of both the Saudi Arabia bid and a multi-nation bid for the 2030 event. The BBC has learned that FA officials are mindful of concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record. However, some are also wary of suggestions of hypocrisy if the body declines to endorse the tournament, but then participates in it. Saudi Arabia is the sole bidder for the 2034 event, while the 2030 World Cup is set to be awarded to unopposed co-hosts Spain, Morocco and Portugal, with early matches also being played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. The ratification process has been combined so the 2030 and 2034 hosts will be decided jointly.

            "In recent years, Saudi Arabia has hosted many major sports events, including Formula One, tennis, boxing and golf. Yet the kingdom's human rights record, restrictions on women's rights and the criminalisation of the LGBTQ+ community has prompted controversy over its ambition to host the men's World Cup in 10 years time. Last week, Fifa released its evaluation report for Saudi Arabia's bid, awarding it an average score of 4.2 out of 5 - the highest ever - with a conclusion that the tournament posed a 'medium' human rights risk. The assessment sparked condemnation from human rights groups.\n",

            "The DFB held a committee meeting on Friday to decide its stance, and unanimous approval was given, external to support the 2030 and 2034 bids. Its president, Bernd Neuendor, explained: \"We did not make the decision lightly and carefully examined the application for the 2034 World Cup. \"There was an exchange with many interest groups and experts, including human rights organisations and fans, on the basis of which a well-founded decision was made. \"We take the criticism of the applicant country seriously and will continue to engage in dialogue. Our goal is to work together with Fifa to improve the situation in the coming years.\" In 2022, England and Germany were among a group of European teams that abandoned plans to promote diversity and inclusion by wearing 'OneLove' armbands at the Qatar World Cup after Fifa threatened sporting sanctions.

            "It is a sign of the complexity of this decision that the FA's hierarchy are still to come down one way or another, with just five days to go. While Saudi Arabia has become a fairly regular host of top-level sport, this would be another level entirely. The German FA's statement essentially acknowledges it will be criticised, and makes clear it did not take the decision lightly. It seems likely, therefore, that whatever decision the English FA takes, it will divide opinion. Any support of the event comes amid strong criticism from human rights and environmental campaigners, and just six weeks after more than one hundred professional women's footballers wrote to Fifa urging it to drop the Saudi oil giant Aramco as a sponsor. They called such a deal a \"punch in the stomach\" to the sport, so awarding the biggest football tournament in the world to the kingdom would likely provoke similar if not stronger criticism. However, there is a school of thought that sport can be a force for positive change, and that putting a spotlight on Saudi Arabia, if it was to host the World Cup, could help accelerate and enhance reforms.\n",

We have to co-exist.\" In May, Fifa rejected claims that Fifpro and the World Leagues Association were not consulted over its plans for the Club World Cup. BBC Sport asked Fifa to justify the scheduling clash with Euro 2025 this month. A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: \"The international match calendar for 2025-2030 was approved by the Fifa Council in 2023, which is made up of members from each of the six confederations, including Uefa. \"While Fifa accepts that both the men's and women's international match calendars are constrained by obvious limitations, this was deemed to be the most balanced solution.\"\n",

I think they waited for the right moment to ask for it,\" said Kallen. \"They got it because in the future I think the stadiums and infrastructure in Switzerland is too small.\" The draw takes place on Monday, 16 December, when defending champions England and tournament debutants Wales will find out their group-stage opponents.

The FA released a statement after the meeting, which said: \"Our focus is on ensuring that all our fans can attend and enjoy tournaments. \"The FA board met the Saudi Arabian Football Federation last month to discuss their bid in more detail. \"We asked them to commit to ensuring all fans would be safe and welcome in Saudi Arabia in 2034 - including LGBTQ+ fans. They assured us that they are fully committed to providing a safe and welcome environment for all fans.\" Some senior FA officials are known to have been wary of accusations of hypocrisy if it were not to support Saudi Arabia but then wants England to participate. The FA will also be mindful of having caved in to Fifa's threats of sporting sanctions at the Qatar World Cup, when it and some other associations abandoned plans for players to wear 'OneLove' armbands intended as an anti-discrimination protest. But with a potential joint bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup, the British football federations may have been keen to avoid a rift with Fifa. And the FA will also have been aware of Saudi Arabia's importance to the UK Government as a key ally in the Middle East, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visiting the country's Crown Prince this week in a bid to strengthen economic ties between the two countries. Last year, Jake Daniels, the UK's only openly gay active male professional footballer, told the BBC he \"wouldn't feel safe\" at a Saudi World Cup.

But in an audio message on Telegram on Saturday morning, Khinshtein gave the latest update, saying there were five fatalities. \"There were no children among those [killed],\" he said. Ukrainian troops still hold parts of the Kursk region after launching a surprise cross-border offensive in early August. Ukraine's foreign ministry said Russia's strike on Kyiv had affected the diplomatic missions of Albania, Argentina, North Macedonia, Palestine, Portugal and Montenegro. It is unclear whether the building housing them was directly targeted in the Ukrainian capital. At least one person was killed and nine others were injured in the strike which damaged a number of buildings in the city, Ukraine's military said. It is not thought that any of the embassy diplomats were injured. In a verified video filmed in the Pecherskyi District, Kyiv's second oldest Roman Catholic church, St Nicholas Cathedral, is shown with windows shattered following a nearby blast. Ukraine's military said Russia had launched 65 drones and missiles across the country overnight, with most shot down.

My neighbour is in such shock she can't even speak. I have no words for the people who did this.\" A local journalist at the scene told the BBC that one of the buildings nearby had been used by the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, and was likely to have been the target of the strikes, although much of the damage seen by the BBC had affected residential buildings. In a statement confirming the attack, the Russian defence ministry said missiles had been launched at an SBU \"command post\" in response to a strike on a chemical plant in Russia's Rostov Region two days ago. But there is also speculation in Kyiv that Friday's attack could be linked to the killing of a Russian general, Lt-Gen Igor Kirillov, in Moscow on Tuesday. Friday's attack come one day after Vladimir Putin's end-of-year press conference and phone-in show, in which he threatened to launch more ballistic missiles at the Ukrainian capital. There is concern in Ukraine that Russia could use a so-called Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile to hit Kyiv. Moscow test-fired the missile on the central city of Dnipro earlier this month.

            "Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia should have launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier and been better prepared for the war. In his end-of-year press conference on Thursday, Putin said, with hindsight, there should have been \"systemic preparation\" for the 2022 invasion, which he refers to as a \"special military operation\". Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and pro-Russian forces began a conflict in eastern Ukraine, but it was eight years later that Putin tried to seize Kyiv. During his four-hour long appearance, Putin also talked about Syria's deposed leader, Russia's more aggressive nuclear doctrine as well as domestic issues, like the price of butter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Billed as \"Results of the Year with Vladimir Putin\", the event was broadcast live across the main state TV channels on Thursday. Putin appeared in front of a large blue screen emblazoned with a map of the Russian Federation, complete with annexed parts of Ukraine. He took questions from members of the public, foreign journalists and pensioners - but it was a highly choreographed and tightly controlled affair. When asked by the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg whether he felt the country was in a better state than where his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, had left it 25 years ago, Putin said Russia had regained its \"sovereignty\". \"With everything that was happening to Russia before that, we were heading towards a complete, total loss of our sovereignty.\"\n",

            "Asked about the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Putin insisted it was not a defeat for the Kremlin - which supported President Bashar al-Assad militarily for years - but he admitted the situation was \"complicated\". He said he had not yet spoken to ousted Syrian leader, who fled to Moscow as rebel forces closed in on Damascus earlier this month, but planned to do so soon. He added that Russia was in talks with Syria's new rulers to retain two strategically important military bases on the Mediterranean coast and that Moscow would consider using them for humanitarian purposes.\n",

            "On US President-elect Donald Trump, Putin said the pair had not spoken in four years, but he was ready to meet him \"if he wants it\". When put to him he was in a weak position compared to Trump, who is set to take office in January, Putin quoted American writer Mark Twain: \"The rumours of my death are much exaggerated,\" prompting a smattering of laughs in the conference hall. Moving on to China, Putin said Russia's relations with its eastern neighbour had reached an all-time high and the two countries were coordinating actions on the world stage. \"In the last decade, the level and quality of our [Russia-China] relations have reached a point that has never existed throughout our entire history, \" he said. A lengthy portion of the session was focused on the war in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was \"open to compromises\" to end the war - although it was unclear what such compromises could entail. Russian forces are making progress on the frontlines \"everyday\", he said, describing his troops as \"heroes\". At one point, he produced a signed flag he said was given to him by Russian marines who were \"fighting for the motherland\" in the Kursk region, and ushered two observers to hold it behind him for the cameras.\n",
            "\n",
            "Putin produced a flag he said was given to him by Russian marines fighting in Kursk\n",
            "\n",
            "He also talked up Russia's construction projects in areas it has seized from Ukraine, claiming the standard of roads in the Ukrainian region of Luhansk had greatly improved since it was seized by Russia-backed forces in 2014. When asked by an audience member if the West had \"received the message\" on Russia's change to its nuclear doctrine, which Putin pushed through in November, he said \"you'll have to ask them.\" The new nuclear doctrine allows Russia to conduct a nuclear strike on any country, if it is backed by a nuclear power. That means if Ukraine were to launch a large attack on Russia with conventional missiles, drones or aircraft, that could meet the criteria for a nuclear response, as could an attack on Belarus or any critical threat to Russia's sovereignty. Putin also emphasised the capabilities of Russia's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, which was used in a strike on Ukraine in November. In order to test its power, he suggested Russia should fire the Oreshnik towards Ukraine, and Ukrainian air defence - using US-supplied systems - should try to bring it down. As for the name \"Oreshnik\"? \"Honestly,\" Putin said with a smirk, \"No idea. No clue.\" A dominant theme throughout the event was \"Russian sovereignty\", with Putin claiming that less reliance on international partners - partly a result of Western sanctions - was one of the key achievements of his invasion of Ukraine. He said the economy was \"stable\", pointing to higher growth than countries like Germany, but admitted inflation of 9.1% was \"alarming\". In fact, the economy is overheating and highly reliant on military production - sometimes termed the \"military industrial complex\". Throughout the address, Putin also answered questions on domestic issues - from telephone scammers to young people's struggles with getting a mortgage.\n",

        "Couchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n",

If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.\n"
