        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and [Anthropic](https://claude.ai/) as the language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

        "# Perform Semantic Search\n",
        "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

            "Tomas Soucek dedicated his goal in West Ham's crucial 2-1 win over Wolves to Michail Antonio - and revealed the players had a video call with their injured team-mate before Monday's game. The Hammers forward, 34, remains in hospital after being involved in a car crash on Saturday. Antonio had surgery on Sunday on a lower limb fracture and will continue to receive care over the coming days. Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored as West Ham overcame Wolves for a vital victory to move nine points clear of the relegation zone and ease the pressure on under-fire head coach Julen Lopetegui. When asked about Antonio, midfielder Soucek told Sky Sports: \"The goal was for him. I said before the game I really wanted to score even more today. \"He's been here since I came here - he is really my favourite. I said it would be tough for me to play without him. \"I am happy that he is doing fine, but this is for him. He is a massive player and he is in my heart.\" The 29-year-old Czech international was worried when he heard the news of Antonio's accident as he added: \"It was really tough for us. I was with the kids and I saw this information on the phone. I messaged everyone asking what happened and how he was. \"I was so scared what was going to happen. It was a really tough week for him, his family and us. \"We had a video call with him, the whole team, before the game. He smiled to us and gave us all the best. I can't wait to visit him. He is a really lovely guy and also funny. He even made a few jokes before the game and he wished us all the best.\" Jamaica international Antonio is West Ham's all-time leading scorer in the Premier League, with 68 goals in 268 league appearances. Soucek held up nine fingers, representing Antonio's shirt number, when celebrating his opener against second-bottom Wolves, while captain Bowen held up Antonio's shirt too after netting the 72nd-minute winner. Antonio joined the club in 2015 and Soucek added: \"He is probably one of the best players West Ham have had. \"He will be soon with us. These things can happen, but hopefully he will be even better soon.\"\n",

I just want to say thank you to all the support from everyone. As captain I've seen all the messages and support Mic has got. \"It is one of those things where life is bigger than football. The main thing is Mic is safe and well and he is here to tell the story. He is a warrior and a fighter, he always has been, through his career and I know he will be back stronger for this.\" Manager Lopetegui added: \"Fortunately he was a miracle, looking at the picture of the the car. These are more important things, the person, the dad, the brother. \"We are happy because he overcame the surgery that he had yesterday.\" There was also a minute's applause for Antonio in the ninth minute at the London Stadium once the game against Wolves had kicked off. The Hammers said the special 'Antonio 9' shirts, walking-out tops and the players' match-worn shirts will be signed and auctioned off, with the proceeds donated to the National Health Service and Air Ambulances UK. In a statement, the club added it \"would like to reiterate heartfelt thanks to the first responders, emergency services, air ambulance staff and the NHS for the incredible support given to Michail in the wake of the accident\".\n",

He told reporters that there were serious concerns for those who had been critically injured and that \"all resources\" will be allocated to investigating the suspect behind the attack. Previously, Reiner Haseloff, the premier of Saxony-Anhalt state, said a preliminary investigation suggested the alleged attacker was acting alone. Prosecutor Horst Walter Nopens said on Saturday that the investigation was ongoing but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".\n",

Originally from Saudi Arabia, al-Abdulmohsen arrived in Germany in 2006 and in 2016 was recognised as a refugee.

The source, who asked not to be named, said these notifications were ignored. However, another experienced counter-terrorism expert said the Saudis may be mounting a disinformation campaign to discredit someone who tried to help young Saudi women seek asylum in Germany.\n",

The channel posted a video of what it said was the burning vehicle with \"press\" signage on the back doors.

Quds Today is affiliated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), an armed group that took part in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. The unprecedented attack triggered the war in Gaza. The TV channel is believed to receive funding from the group. In a separate development, the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital on the northern edge of Gaza said on Thursday about 50 people, including five of its staff, had been killed in an Israeli strike on a building by the hospital. A paediatrician and two paramedics were among them. The IDF said it was \"unaware of strikes\" in the hospital area, adding that it was looking into claims that five doctors had been killed. \"The number of casualties reported in the media does not align with the information held by the IDF,\" it said. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was \"devastated by the reports\" of five journalists being killed in the central Gaza Strip. \"Journalists are civilians and must always be protected,\" it said. The Israeli military named the five killed as Ibrahim Jamal Ibrahim Al-Sheikh Ali; Faisal Abdallah Muhammad Abu Qamsan; Mohammed Ayad Khamis al-Ladaa; Ayman Nihad Abd Alrahman Jadi; and Fadi Ihab Muhammad Ramadan Hassouna. It said \"intelligence from multiple sources confirmed\" that all were PIJ operatives, and that a list found during an operation in Gaza \"explicitly identified four\" of them as such. In a statement, Quds Today said the men \"were killed as they carried out their media and humanitarian duty\". As of 20 December, at least 133 Palestinian journalists have been killed during the course of the war, making it the deadliest conflict for journalists, according to the CPJ. The press freedom organisation has called for accountability for Palestinian journalists who have been directly targeted by the Israeli military. At least another five people were also reported killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza City on Wednesday. The Palestinian Wafa news agency, and the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, also said a further 20 people were injured in the city's al-Zeitoun neighbourhood. The Israeli military has not commented on the reported bombing. Meanwhile, the father of a two-week-old Palestinian girl has told the BBC how his baby daughter froze to death in a tent in Gaza - the third child in a week to die in similar conditions. Mahmoud Ismail Al-Faseeh said he woke up in the severe cold to find his daughter, Sila, suffering convulsions. She was rushed to hospital but died from hypothermia, the head of paediatrics at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis told the Associated Press news agency. The family was sheltering in al-Mawasi area on Gaza's coast, a strip of land designated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as a humanitarian zone but which has been hit by air strikes. Ahmed al-Farra, the head of paediatrics, said two other babies - one three days old and the other a month old - had been brought in over the past 48 hours after dying from hypothermia. Hopes of progress towards a ceasefire in recent days have begun to recede, with Hamas and Israel blaming each other. Hamas accused the Israeli government of imposing \"new conditions\" that it said were delaying the agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the group was reneging on understandings that had already been reached about a possible ceasefire. The latest statements mark a notable change of tone on both sides following optimistic signals. The Israeli military launched air strikes and a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip in response to last year's Hamas attack. About 1,200 people were killed in the attack and another 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Almost two million people - 90% of the population - have been displaced, according to the UN.\n",

Earlier, the presidential spokesman, Paulo Pimenta, had said that Lula would likely remain in the intensive care unit for another 48 hours. \"He is stable, conscious and calm,\" Mr Pimenta said. While Lula is in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin will take on some of the president's commitments, including welcoming Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is due to arrive in Brazil later today.

Lula had slipped in the bathroom in the Alvorada Palace on 19 October and hit the back of his head. He had to have five stitches and, on his doctors' advice, cancelled his planned trip to Russia for a summit of the Brics countries. He returned to full duties days later.

Mr Mangione's arrest follows a days-long manhunt that spanned several states. He was allegedly found with a gun similar to the murder weapon, a silencer and a fake ID. Three handwritten pages were allegedly also in his possession. New York police said they took these to be a claim of responsibility in Mr Thompson's fatal shooting, since they appeared to record frustrations with the US healthcare system. The UnitedHealthcare chief executive, 50, was gunned down by a masked man outside a Manhattan hotel in what authorities have called a targeted attack.\n",

            "Mr Mangione was denied bail for a second time on Tuesday, after prosecutors said he was too dangerous to be released.

Hochul later said she would provide one. \"I am co-ordinating with the District Attorney's Office and will sign a request for a governor's warrant to ensure this individual is tried and held accountable,\" she said. Defence lawyers also have a two-week window in which to submit motions against Mr Mangione being moved to New York. The challenge was described by a Pennsylvania prosecutor as creating \"more hoops... to jump through\". Mr Mangione looked around at the rows of reporters in court and smiled at times. At one point, he interrupted his own lawyer, who quickly quietened him. Following the hearing on Tuesday afternoon, that lawyer, Thomas Dickey, spoke to reporters outside court. \"You can't rush to judgement in this case or any case,\" he said. \"He's presumed innocent. Let's not forget that.\" Mr Dickey reiterated his position to ABC News on Wednesday, saying he was not aware of any evidence that linked Mr Mangione's gun with the crime. \"A lot of guns look the same,\" he added. As for the handwritten pages - Mr Dickey conceded that they \"certainly, could be\" evidence, but added: \"I haven't seen any of that yet.\" Mr Mangione has been charged with several offences in Pennsylvania, including providing fraudulent identification to police and possessing an unlicensed firearm. He is being held at a Pennsylvania state prison and will plead not guilty. In New York, he faces separate charges including murder for Mr Thompson's killing on 4 December.\n",

            "Mr Thompson was named chief executive of the company, which is the largest private insurer in the US, in April 2021. He had received threats before his death relating to medical coverage, according to his widow, Paulette Thompson, but a motive for his killing has not been suggested by prosecutors. On Tuesday, however, as police pored through evidence and worked to piece together Mr Mangione's movements after the shooting, more details emerged about his alleged grievances with the health insurance industry. New York Police Department's Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told Good Morning America that he had read a three-page handwritten note allegedly found on the suspect when he was arrested. \"He does make some indication that he's frustrated with the healthcare system in the United States,\" he said. \"He was writing a lot about his disdain for corporate America and in particular the healthcare industry.\" The note, which has been seen by several US media outlets, reportedly refers to \"parasites\" that \"had it coming\". He also allegedly writes that he acted alone.\n",

            "Former friends who spoke to the BBC said Mr Mangione had suffered from a back injury. They said he had left a surfing community in Hawaii over the summer of 2023 to undergo spinal surgery. RJ Martin, a former roommate of the suspect who knew him in Hawaii, said the injury \"prohibited him, at times, from just doing many normal things\". Various details of Mr Mangione's background have surfaced since his arrest. He was born in Maryland, to a wealthy, well-known family, and police say he has ties to San Francisco, California. His last-known address was in Honolulu, Hawaii. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college, where he earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in software engineering. Local media reported that Mr Mangione's mother had reported him missing last month, telling authorities in San Francisco that she had not heard from her son since July. \"Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest,\" Mr Mangione's family said in a statement posted on social media by his cousin. \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\"\n",

            "Score: 0.7605, Text: Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has questioned the \"choices\" of people close to forward Marcus Rashford. Rashford, 27, said he was \"ready for a new challenge\" in an interview after being dropped for the 2-1 win at Manchester City on 15 December. The England international subsequently missed the 4-3 Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat by Tottenham and was also left out as United lost 3-0 to Bournemouth on Sunday, adding to speculation he could leave Old Trafford in January. \"I understand these players have a lot of people around them, making choices that are not the first idea from the player. \"They chose to do the interview as it is not just Marcus.\"\n",

            "This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. 'He wants to play. He is trying'\n",
            "\n",
            "Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club since making his debut in 2016, having come through the United youth ranks. However, while he managed 30 goals in all competitions in 2022-23, he has struggled for form in three of the previous four seasons and attracted criticism from pundits and fans for a number of laboured displays during that time. Amorim said he can \"separate\" the decisions of those advising Rashford from his relationship with the player. \"At the moment I'm focused on improving Marcus,\" he added. \"We need a talented guy like Marcus. I forget the interview now and see what I see on the pitch.\" Regarding Rashford's future, the Portuguese boss said it is for him and the club \"to deal with that when the time comes\". Speaking to the wider media before United face Wolverhampton Wanderers on Thursday, Amorim denied the talk around Rashford was a distraction, adding: \"Some guys have a big responsibility here because they have been here for a long time. \"If you have big talents, [we need] big performances, big responsibility, big engagement to push everybody forward in this moment. Like any other player, [we want him to be] the best he can be. \"This is maybe one of the lowest moments in our club. We have to face it and be strong.\" United's humbling defeat by the Cherries means they head into Christmas in 13th place in the Premier League, after Wolves they host Newcastle on 30 December. It will be their lowest position in the table at this stage since they were 15th in 1986, just over two months into Sir Alex Ferguson's reign as manager. Amorim had to halt his post-match news conference on Sunday because of a leak in the ceiling of the press room. Asked later how he intended to reverse fortunes at Old Trafford, the former Sporting coach pointed to the ceiling and said: \"If I knew, I would solve all the problems of this club, even this. \"I know what I am going to do. That is so clear for me. I will not say I feel relaxed because I'm really frustrated. It's a very difficult moment but we will solve problems step by step and find answers for everything.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been discharged from hospital after undergoing emergency surgery for a brain bleed, doctors said. The 79-year-old appeared alongside his medical team at a news conference at Sírio-Libanês hospital in São Paulo. \"This here is not an interview, this is simply a session to say thanks. To thank, firstly, God, who has looked after me in a very generous manner,\" he said. Lula was taken to hospital on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctors performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced. The brain bleed, or intracranial haemorrhage, was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement. \"Thank you very much for the prayers,\" Lula added on Sunday. \"And for those who only have hate, you're forgiven. I am here, alive, whole, and with more desire to work.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "On Tuesday, doctors said the president was in a stable condition following the surgery and was conscious. Lula was \"lucid\" and conversing with medical staff, they added. They also insisted that he had not sustained any brain injury and was not experiencing after-effects from the surgery. Asked when he would return to the capital, doctors had said that if everything went well, they expected Lula to be back in Brasilia \"next week\". While Lula was in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin took on some of the president's commitments. The doctors said the bleeding was a result of the fall Lula had sustained in October. They explained that it was not unusual for problems from a blow to the head to appear \"months later\". Lula had slipped in the bathroom in the Alvorada Palace on 19 October and hit the back of his head. On Sunday, he explained he had been cutting his toe nails at the time and had been sitting down. He went on to have five stitches. On his doctors' advice, the president cancelled his planned trip to Russia for a summit of the Brics countries. He returned to full duties days later. Lula has been in power since January last year after narrowly beating the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in a bitterly fought election. During the election campaign, he often joked that he had \"the energy of a 30-year-old\".\n",
