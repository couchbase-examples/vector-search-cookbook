        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and [Anthropic](https://claude.ai/) as the language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch."

When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

            "\n",
            "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says he is \"fine\" despite admitting his sleep and diet are being affected by the worst run of results in his entire managerial career. In an interview with former Italy international Luca Toni for Amazon Prime Sport before Wednesday's Champions League defeat by Juventus, Guardiola touched on the personal impact City's sudden downturn in form has had. Guardiola said his state of mind was \"ugly\", that his sleep was \"worse\" and he was eating lighter as his digestion had suffered. City go into Sunday's derby against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium having won just one of their past 10 games. The Juventus loss means there is a chance they may not even secure a play-off spot in the Champions League. Asked to elaborate on his comments to Toni, Guardiola said: \"I'm fine. \"In our jobs we always want to do our best or the best as possible. When that doesn't happen you are more uncomfortable than when the situation is going well, always that happened. \"In good moments I am happier but when I get to the next game I am still concerned about what I have to do. There is no human being that makes an activity and it doesn't matter how they do.\" Guardiola said City have to defend better and \"avoid making mistakes at both ends\". To emphasise his point, Guardiola referred back to the third game of City's current run, against a Sporting side managed by Ruben Amorim, who will be in the United dugout at the weekend. City dominated the first half in Lisbon, led thanks to Phil Foden's early effort and looked to be cruising. Instead, they conceded three times in 11 minutes either side of half-time as Sporting eventually ran out 4-1 winners. \"I would like to play the game like we played in Lisbon on Sunday, believe me,\" said Guardiola, who is facing the prospect of only having three fit defenders for the derby as Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji try to overcome injury concerns. If there is solace for City, it comes from the knowledge United are not exactly flying. Their comeback Europa League victory against Viktoria Plzen on Thursday was their third win of Amorim's short reign so far but only one of those successes has come in the Premier League, where United have lost their past two games against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest. Nevertheless, Guardiola can see improvements already on the red side of the city. \"It's already there,\" he said. \"You see all the patterns, the movements, the runners and the pace. He will do a good job at United, I'm pretty sure of that.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Guardiola says skipper Kyle Walker has been offered support by the club after the City defender highlighted the racial abuse he had received on social media in the wake of the Juventus trip. \"It's unacceptable,\" he said. \"Not because it's Kyle - for any human being. \"Unfortunately it happens many times in the real world. It is not necessary to say he has the support of the entire club. It is completely unacceptable and we give our support to him.\"\n",

            "Guardiola has also been giving it a lot of thought. He has not been sleeping very well, as he has said, and has not been himself at times when talking to the media. He has been talking to a lot of people about what is going on as he tries to work out the reasons for City's demise. Some reasons he knows, others he still doesn't. What people perhaps do not realise is Guardiola hugely doubts himself and always has. He will be thinking \"I'm not going to be able to get us out of this\" and needs the support of people close to him to push away those insecurities - and he has that. He is protected by his people who are very aware, like he is, that there are a lot of people that want City to fail. It has been a turbulent time for Guardiola. Remember those marks he had on his head after the 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the Champions League? He always scratches his head, it is a gesture of nervousness. Normally nothing happens but on that day one of his nails was far too sharp so, after talking to the players in the changing room where he scratched his head because of his usual agitated gesturing, he went to the news conference. His right-hand man Manel Estiarte sent him photos in a message saying \"what have you got on your head?\", but by the time Guardiola returned to the coaching room there was hardly anything there again. He started that day with a cover on his nose after the same thing happened at the training ground the day before. Guardiola was having a footballing debate with Kyle Walker about positional stuff and marked his nose with that same nail. There was also that remarkable news conference after the Manchester derby when he said \"I don't know what to do\". That is partly true and partly not true. Ignore the fact Guardiola suggested he was \"not good enough\". He actually meant he was not good enough to resolve the situation with the group of players he has available and with all the other current difficulties. There are obviously logical explanations for the crisis and the first one has been talked about many times - the absence of injured midfielder Rodri. You know the game Jenga? When you take the wrong piece out, the whole tower collapses. That is what has happened here. It is normal for teams to have an over-reliance on one player if he is the best in the world in his position. And you cannot calculate the consequences of an injury that rules someone like Rodri out for the season. City are a team, like many modern ones, in which the holding midfielder is a key element to the construction. So, when you take Rodri out, it is difficult to hold it together. There were Plan Bs - John Stones, Manuel Akanji, even Nathan Ake - but injuries struck. The big injury list has been out of the ordinary and the busy calendar has also played a part in compounding the issues. However, one factor even Guardiola cannot explain is the big uncharacteristic errors in almost every game from international players. Why did Matheus Nunes make that challenge to give away the penalty against Manchester United? Jack Grealish is sent on at the end to keep the ball and cannot do that. There are errors from Walker and other defenders. These are some of the best players in the world. Of course the players' mindset is important, and confidence is diminishing. Wrong decisions get taken so there is almost panic on the pitch instead of calm. There are also players badly out of form who are having to play because of injuries. Walker is now unable to hide behind his pace, I'm not sure Kevin de Bruyne is ever getting back to the level he used to be at, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan do not have time to rest, Grealish is not playing at his best. Some of these players were only meant to be playing one game a week but, because of injuries, have played 12 games in 40 days. It all has a domino effect. One consequence is that Erling Haaland isn't getting the service to score. But the Norwegian still remains City's top-scorer with 13. Defender Josko Gvardiol is next on the list with just four. The way their form has been analysed inside the City camp is there have only been three games where they deserved to lose (Liverpool, Bournemouth and Aston Villa). But of course it is time to change the dynamic.\n",

            "Guardiola has never protected his players so much. He has not criticised them and is not going to do so. They have won everything with him. Instead of doing more with them, he has tried doing less. He has sometimes given them more days off to clear their heads, so they can reset - two days this week for instance. Perhaps the time to change a team is when you are winning, but no-one was suggesting Man City were about to collapse when they were top and unbeaten after nine league games. Some people have asked how bad it has to get before City make a decision on Guardiola. The answer is that there is no decision to be made. Maybe if this was Real Madrid, Barcelona or Juventus, the pressure from outside would be massive and the argument would be made that Guardiola has to go. At City he has won the lot, so how can anyone say he is failing? Yes, this is a crisis. But given all their problems, City's renewed target is finishing in the top four. That is what is in all their heads now. The idea is to recover their essence by improving defensive concepts that are not there and re-establishing the intensity they are known for. Guardiola is planning to use the next two years of his contract, which is expected to be his last as a club manager, to prepare a new Manchester City. When he was at the end of his four years at Barcelona, he asked two managers what to do when you feel people are not responding to your instructions. Do you go or do the players go? Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafael Benitez both told him that the players need to go. Guardiola did not listen because of his emotional attachment to his players back then and he decided to leave the Camp Nou because he felt the cycle was over. He will still protect his players now but there is not the same emotional attachment - so it is the players who are going to leave this time. It is likely City will look to replace five or six regular starters. Guardiola knows it is the end of an era and the start of a new one. Changes will not be immediate and the majority of the work will be done in the summer. But they are open to any opportunities in January - and a holding midfielder is one thing they need. In the summer City might want to get Spain's Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and they know 60m euros (£50m) will get him. He said no to Liverpool last summer even though everything was agreed, but he now wants to move on and the Premier League is the target. Even if they do not get Zubimendi, that is the calibre of footballer they are after. A new Manchester City is on its way - with changes driven by Guardiola, incoming sporting director Hugo Viana and the football department.\n",

            "Manchester City are currently in relegation form and there is little sign of it ending. Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa left them joint bottom of the form table over the past eight games with just Southampton for company. Saints, at the foot of the Premier League, have the same number of points, four, as City over their past eight matches having won one, drawn one and lost six - the same record as the floundering champions. And if Southampton - who appointed Ivan Juric as their new manager on Saturday - get at least a point at Fulham on Sunday, City will be on the worst run in the division. Even Wolves, who sacked boss Gary O'Neil last Sunday and replaced him with Vitor Pereira, have earned double the number of points during the same period having played a game fewer. They are damning statistics for Pep Guardiola, even if he does have some mitigating circumstances with injuries to Ederson, Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias - who all missed the loss at Villa Park - and the long-term loss of midfield powerhouse Rodri. Guardiola was happy with Saturday's performance, despite defeat in Birmingham, but there is little solace to take at slipping further out of the title race. He may have needed to field a half-fit Manuel Akanji and John Stones at Villa Park but that does not account for City looking a shadow of their former selves. That does not justify the error Josko Gvardiol made to gift Jhon Duran a golden chance inside the first 20 seconds, or £100m man Jack Grealish again failing to have an impact on a game. There may be legitimate reasons for City's drop off, whether that be injuries, mental fatigue or just simply a team coming to the end of its lifecycle, but their form, which has plunged off a cliff edge, would have been unthinkable as they strolled to a fourth straight title last season. \"The worrying thing is the number of goals conceded,\" said ex-England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day. \"The number of times they were opened up because of the lack of protection and legs in midfield was staggering. There are so many things that are wrong at this moment in time.\"\n",

            "Afterwards Guardiola was calm, so much so it was difficult to hear him in the news conference, a contrast to the frustrated figure he cut on the touchline. He said: \"It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult.

            "\n",
            "Manchester City are currently in relegation form and there is little sign of it ending. Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa left them joint bottom of the form table over the past eight games with just Southampton for company. Saints, at the foot of the Premier League, have the same number of points, four, as City over their past eight matches having won one, drawn one and lost six - the same record as the floundering champions. And if Southampton - who appointed Ivan Juric as their new manager on Saturday - get at least a point at Fulham on Sunday, City will be on the worst run in the division. Even Wolves, who sacked boss Gary O'Neil last Sunday and replaced him with Vitor Pereira, have earned double the number of points during the same period having played a game fewer. They are damning statistics for Pep Guardiola, even if he does have some mitigating circumstances with injuries to Ederson, Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias - who all missed the loss at Villa Park - and the long-term loss of midfield powerhouse Rodri. Guardiola was happy with Saturday's performance, despite defeat in Birmingham, but there is little solace to take at slipping further out of the title race. He may have needed to field a half-fit Manuel Akanji and John Stones at Villa Park but that does not account for City looking a shadow of their former selves. That does not justify the error Josko Gvardiol made to gift Jhon Duran a golden chance inside the first 20 seconds, or £100m man Jack Grealish again failing to have an impact on a game. There may be legitimate reasons for City's drop off, whether that be injuries, mental fatigue or just simply a team coming to the end of its lifecycle, but their form, which has plunged off a cliff edge, would have been unthinkable as they strolled to a fourth straight title last season. \"The worrying thing is the number of goals conceded,\" said ex-England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day. \"The number of times they were opened up because of the lack of protection and legs in midfield was staggering. There are so many things that are wrong at this moment in time.\"\n",

            "Afterwards Guardiola was calm, so much so it was difficult to hear him in the news conference, a contrast to the frustrated figure he cut on the touchline. He said: \"It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult.

            "Pep Guardiola says his sleep has suffered during Manchester City's deepening crisis, so he will not be helped by a nightmarish conclusion to one of the most stunning defeats of his long reign. Guardiola looked agitated, animated and on edge even after City led the Manchester derby through Josko Gvardiol's 36th-minute header, his reaction to the goal one of almost disdain that it came via a deflected cross as opposed to in his purist style. He sat alone with his eyes closed sipping from a water bottle before the resumption of the second half, then was denied even the respite of victory when Manchester United gave this largely dismal derby a dramatic conclusion it barely deserved with a remarkable late comeback. First, with 88 minutes on the clock, Matheus Nunes presented Amad Diallo with the ball before compounding his error by flattening the forward as he made an attempt to recover his mistake. Bruno Fernandes completed the formalities from the penalty spot. Worse was to come two minutes later when Lisandro Martinez's routine long ball caught City's defence inexplicably statuesque. Goalkeeper Ederson's positioning was awry, allowing the lively Diallo to pounce from an acute angle to leave Guardiola and his players stunned. It was the latest into any game, 88 minutes, that reigning Premier League champions had led then lost. It was also the first time City had lost a game they were leading so late on. And in a sign of City's previous excellence that is now being challenged, they have only lost four of 105 Premier League home games under Guardiola in which they have been ahead at half-time, winning 94 and drawing seven. Guardiola delivered a brutal self-analysis as he told Match of the Day: \"I am not good enough. I am the boss. I am the manager. I have to find solutions and so far I haven't. That's the reality. \"Not much else to say. No defence. Manchester United were incredibly persistent. We have not lost eight games in two seasons. We can't defend that.\"\n",

            "Guardiola suggested the serious renewal will wait until the summer but the red flags have been appearing for weeks in the sudden and shocking decline of a team that has lost the aura of invincibility that left many opponents beaten before kick-off in previous years. He has had stated City must \"survive\" this season - whatever qualifies as survival for a club of such rich ambition - but the quest for a record fifth successive Premier League title is surely over as they lie nine points behind leaders Liverpool having played a game more. Their Champions League aspirations are also in jeopardy after another loss, this time against Juventus in Turin. City's squad has been allowed to grow too old together. The insatiable thirst for success seems to have gone, the scales of superiority have fallen away and opponents now sense vulnerability right until the final whistle, as United did here. The manner in which United were able, and felt able, to snatch this victory drove right to the heart of how City, and Guardiola, are allowing opponents to prey on their downfall. Guardiola has every reason to cite injuries, most significantly to Rodri and also John Stones as well as others, but this cannot be used an excuse for such a dramatic decline in standards, allied to the appearance of a soft underbelly that is so easily exploited. And City's rebuild will not be a quick fix. With every performance, every defeat, the scale of what lies in front of Guardiola becomes more obvious - and daunting. Manchester City's fans did their best to reassure Guardiola of their faith in him with a giant Barcelona-inspired banner draped from the stands before kick-off emblazoned with his image reading \"Més que un entrenador\" - \"More Than A Coach\". And Guardiola will now need to be more than a coach than at any time in his career. He will have the finances but it will be done with City's challengers also strengthening. Kevin de Bruyne, 34 in June, lasted 68 minutes here before he was substituted. Age and injuries are catching up with one of the greatest players of the Premier League era and he is unlikely to be at City next season. Mateo Kovacic, who replaced De Bruyne, is also 31 in May. Kyle Walker, 34, is being increasingly exposed. His most notable contribution here was an embarrassing collapse to the ground after the mildest head-to-head collision with Rasmus Hojlund. Ilkay Gundogan, another 34-year-old and a previous pillar of Guardiola's great successes, no longer has the legs or energy to exert influence. This looks increasingly like a season too far following his return from Barcelona. Flaws are also being exposed elsewhere, with previously reliable performers failing to hit previous standards. Phil Foden scored 27 goals and had 12 assists when he was Premier League Player of the Season last term. This year he has just three goals and two assists in 18 appearances in all competitions. He has no goals and just one assist in 11 Premier League games. Jack Grealish, who came on after 77 minutes against United, has not scored in a year for Manchester City, his last goal coming in a 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace on 16 December last year. He has, in the meantime, scored twice for England. Erling Haaland is also struggling as City lack creativity and cutting edge. He has three goals in his past 11 Premier League games after scoring 10 in his first five. And in another indication of City's impotence, and their reliance on Haaland, defender Gvardiol's goal against United was his fourth this season, making him their second highest scorer in all competitions behind the Norwegian striker, who has 18. Goalkeeper Ederson, so reliable for so long, has already been dropped once this season and did not cover himself in glory for United's winner. Guardiola, with that freshly signed two-year contract, insists he \"wants it\" as he treads on this alien territory of failure. He will be under no illusions about the size of the job in front of him as he placed his head in his hands in anguish after yet another damaging and deeply revealing defeat. City and Guardiola are in new, unforgiving territory.\n",

        "# Using Couchbase as a caching mechanism\n",
        "Couchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "For subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.\n"
