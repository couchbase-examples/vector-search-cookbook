title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Couchbase, OpenAI, and Anthropic using Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index
short_title: Claude AI RAG with Query Vector Index
description:
  - Learn how to build a semantic search engine using Couchbase, OpenAI embeddings, and Anthropic using Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index.
  - This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Couchbase's vector search capabilities with OpenAI embeddings and use Anthropic as the language model.
  - You'll understand how to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and Couchbase.
