    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as the AI-powered embedding and [Anthropic](https://claude.ai/) as the language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes from scratch. For more information on vector indexes, see the [Couchbase documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/use-vector-indexes.html). Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using Couchbase Search Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-openai-claude-couchbase-rag-with-search-vector-index/)"

    "#  Setting Up the Couchbase Query Vector Store\n",
    "A vector store is where we'll keep our embeddings. The query vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, GSI converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables us to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector store requires a distance metric to determine how similarity between vectors is calculated. This is crucial for accurate semantic search results as different distance metrics can yield different similarity rankings. Some of the supported Distance strategies are dot, l2, euclidean, cosine, l2_squared, euclidean_squared. In our implementation we will use cosine which is particularly effective for text embeddings."

    "# Perform Semantic Search\n",
    "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the `similarity_search_with_score` method of the `CouchbaseQueryVectorStore`. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and the distance that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

    "- High performance with low memory footprint - designed to scale to billions of vectors\n",
    "- Optimized for concurrent operations - supports simultaneous searches and inserts\n",
    "- Use when: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering\n",
    "- Ideal for: Large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, content discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite Vector Indexes \n",
    "- Best for filtered vector searches - combines vector search with scalar value filtering\n",
    "- Efficient pre-filtering - scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope\n",
    "- Use when: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data\n",
    "- Ideal for: Compliance-based filtering, user-specific searches, time-bounded queries\n",

    "Choosing the Right Index Type\n",
    "- Start with Hyperscale Vector Index for pure vector searches and large datasets\n",

    "- PQ (Product Quantization): PQ<subquantizers>x<bits> (e.g., PQ32x8)\n",
    "- Higher values = better accuracy, larger index size\n",

In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query\u2019s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a generative language model within LangChain.\n",

This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase\u2019s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while LangChain handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation."

    "# Using Couchbase as a caching mechanism\n",
    "Couchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently.\n"
