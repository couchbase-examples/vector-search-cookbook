Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the Search Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-openai-anthropic-couchbase-rag-with-search-vector-index)"

This account provides you with an environment where you can explore and learn about Capella with no time constraint.\n\nTo know more, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html).\n\nNote: To run this tutorial, you will need Capella with Couchbase Server version 8.0 or above as Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index is supported only from version 8.0\n\n#### Couchbase Capella Configuration\n\nWhen running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met.\n\n* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.\n* [Allow access](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running."

Then, using the vector store's add_texts method, we add the filtered articles to our vector database. The batch_size parameter controls how many articles are processed in each iteration.\n\nThis approach offers several benefits:\n1. Memory Efficiency: Processing in smaller batches prevents memory overload\n2. Progress Tracking: Easier to monitor and track the ingestion progress\n3. Resource Management: Better control over CPU and network resource utilization\n\nWe use a conservative batch size of 100 to ensure reliable operation.\nThe optimal batch size depends on many factors including:\n- Document sizes being inserted\n- Available system resources\n- Network conditions\n- Concurrent workload\n\nConsider measuring performance with your specific workload before adjusting.\n"

This method takes an index type (HYPERSCALE or COMPOSITE) and description parameter for optimization settings. Alternatively, Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes can be created manually from the Couchbase UI."

      "Query 1: What happened when Apple's AI feature generated a false BBC headline about a murder case in New York?\n",
      "Response: According to the context, Apple Intelligence (an AI feature that summarizes notifications) generated a false headline that made it appear as if BBC News had published an article claiming Luigi Mangione, who was arrested for the murder of healthcare insurance CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. This was completely false - Mangione had not shot himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BBC complained to Apple about this misrepresentation, with a BBC spokesperson stating they had \"contacted Apple to raise this concern and fix the problem.\" The spokesperson emphasized that it's \"essential\" that audiences can trust information published under the BBC name, including notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wasn't an isolated incident, as the context mentions that Apple's AI feature also misrepresented a New York Times article, incorrectly summarizing it as \"Netanyahu arrested\" when the actual article was about the International Criminal Court issuing an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister.\n",

      "Query 2: What happened with the map shown during the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw regarding Ukraine and Crimea? What was the controversy?\n",
      "Response: During the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, a map was shown that excluded Crimea as part of Ukraine. This graphic, which was displaying countries that cannot be drawn to play each other for geopolitical reasons, highlighted Ukraine but did not include the Crimean peninsula, which is internationally recognized as Ukrainian territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This omission sparked significant controversy because Crimea has been under Russian occupation since 2014, but only a handful of countries recognize it as Russian territory. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Heorhiy Tykhy, called this an \"unacceptable error\" and stated that Ukraine expected \"a public apology\" from FIFA. He criticized FIFA for acting \"against international law\" and supporting \"Russian propaganda, war crimes, and the crime of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ukrainian Football Association also sent a formal letter of complaint to FIFA and UEFA officials expressing their \"deep concern\" about the cartographic representation. FIFA acknowledged they were \"aware of an issue\" and subsequently removed the image.\n",
