    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Couchbase Capella as the database, [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3](https://build.nvidia.com/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v03/modelcard) model as the as the large language model provided by Capella Model Services. We will use the [NVIDIA NeMo Retriever Llama3.2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2/modelcard) model for generating embeddings via Capella Model Services. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a RAG system using:\n",
    "- The [BBC News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime) containing news articles\n",
    "- Couchbase Capella as the vector store with Search Service(formerly known as Full Text Search) for vector index creation\n",
    "- Capella Model Services for embeddings and text generation\n",
    "- LangChain framework for the RAG pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage Couchbase's Search service to create and manage search vector indexes, enabling efficient semantic search capabilities. Search service provides the infrastructure for storing, indexing, and querying high-dimensional vector embeddings alongside traditional text search functionality. This tutorial can also be recreated using the Query and Indexing services using [Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes](http://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/use-vector-indexes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval.

    "### Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a multi-node Capella cluster running the Data, Query, Index, and Search services.\n",
    "* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Deploy Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the RAG application, we need an embedding model to ingest the documents for Vector Search and a large language model (LLM) for generating the responses based on the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Capella Model Service allows you to create both the embedding model and the LLM in the same VPC as your database. There are multiple options for both the Embedding & Large Language Models, along with Value Adds to the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the models using the Capella Model Services interface. While creating the model, it is possible to cache the responses (both standard and semantic cache) and apply guardrails to the LLM responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/ai/build/model-service/model-service.html). These models are compatible with the [LangChain OpenAI integration](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the models are deployed, please create the API keys for them and whitelist the keys on the IP on which the tutorial is being run. For more details, please refer to the documentation on [generating the API keys](https://docs.couchbase.com/ai/api-guide/api-start.html#model-service-keys).\n"

    "# Installing Necessary Libraries\n",
    "To build our RAG system, we need a set of libaries. The libraries we install handle everything from connecting to databases to performing AI tasks. Each library has a specific role: Couchbase libraries manage database operations, LangChain handles AI model integrations, and we will use the OpenAI SDK for generating embeddings and calling the LLM in Capella Model services. By setting up these libraries, we ensure our environment is equipped to handle the tasks required for RAG."

Just a day earlier, faith healer Bibi - wrapped in a white shawl, her face covered by a white veil - stood atop a shipping container on the edge of the city as thousands of her husband’s devoted followers waved flags and chanted slogans beneath her. It was the latest protest to flare since Khan, the 72-year-old cricketing icon-turned-politician, was jailed more than a year ago after falling foul of the country\\'s influential military which helped catapult him to power. “My children and my brothers! You have to stand with me,” Bibi cried on Tuesday afternoon, her voice cutting through the deafening roar of the crowd. “But even if you don’t,” she continued, “I will still stand firm. “This is not just about my husband. It is about this country and its leader.” It was, noted some watchers of Pakistani politics, her political debut. But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there was no sign of Bibi, nor the thousands of protesters who had marched through the country to the heart of the capital, demanding the release of their jailed leader. While other PMs have fallen out with Pakistan\\'s military in the past, Khan\\'s refusal to stay quiet behind bars is presenting an extraordinary challenge - escalating the standoff and leaving the country deeply divided. Exactly what happened to the so-called “final march”, and Bibi, when the city went dark is still unclear. All eyewitnesses like Samia* can say for certain is that the lights went out suddenly, plunging D Chowk, the square where they had gathered, into blackness.\\n\\nWithin a day of arriving, the protesters had scattered - leaving behind Bibi\\'s burnt-out vehicle\\n\\nAs loud screams and clouds of tear gas blanketed the square, Samia describes holding her husband on the pavement, bloodied from a gun shot to his shoulder. \"Everyone was running for their lives,\" she later told BBC Urdu from a hospital in Islamabad, adding it was \"like doomsday or a war\". \"His blood was on my hands and the screams were unending.” But how did the tide turn so suddenly and decisively? Just hours earlier, protesters finally reached D Chowk late afternoon on Tuesday. They had overcome days of tear gas shelling and a maze of barricaded roads to get to the city centre. Many of them were supporters and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party led by Khan. He had called for the march from his jail cell, where he has been for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated. Now Bibi - his third wife, a woman who had been largely shrouded in mystery and out of public view since their unexpected wedding in 2018 - was leading the charge. “We won’t go back until we have Khan with us,” she declared as the march reached D Chowk, deep in the heart of Islamabad’s government district.\\n\\nThousands had marched for days to reach Islamabad, demanding former Prime Minister Imran Khan be released from jail\\n\\nInsiders say even the choice of destination - a place where her husband had once led a successful sit in - was Bibi’s, made in the face of other party leader’s opposition, and appeals from the government to choose another gathering point. Her being at the forefront may have come as a surprise. Bibi, only recently released from prison herself, is often described as private and apolitical. Little is known about her early life, apart from the fact she was a spiritual guide long before she met Khan. Her teachings, rooted in Sufi traditions, attracted many followers - including Khan himself. Was she making her move into politics - or was her sudden appearance in the thick of it a tactical move to keep Imran Khan’s party afloat while he remains behind bars? For critics, it was a move that clashed with Imran Khan’s oft-stated opposition to dynastic politics. There wasn’t long to mull the possibilities. After the lights went out, witnesses say that police started firing fresh rounds of tear gas at around 21:30 local time (16:30 GMT). The crackdown was in full swing just over an hour later. At some point, amid the chaos, Bushra Bibi left. Videos on social media appeared to show her switching cars and leaving the scene. The BBC couldn’t verify the footage. By the time the dust settled, her container had already been set on fire by unknown individuals. By 01:00 authorities said all the protesters had fled.\\n\\nSecurity was tight in the city, and as night fell, lights were switched off - leaving many in the dark as to what exactly happened next\\n\\nEyewitnesses have described scenes of chaos, with tear gas fired and police rounding up protesters. One, Amin Khan, said from behind an oxygen mask that he joined the march knowing that, \"either I will bring back Imran Khan or I will be shot\". The authorities have have denied firing at the protesters. They also said some of the protesters were carrying firearms. The BBC has seen hospital records recording patients with gunshot injuries. However, government spokesperson Attaullah Tarar told the BBC that hospitals had denied receiving or treating gunshot wound victims. He added that \"all security personnel deployed on the ground have been forbidden\" from having live ammunition during protests. But one doctor told BBC Urdu that he had never done so many surgeries for gunshot wounds in a single night. \"Some of the injured came in such critical condition that we had to start surgery right away instead of waiting for anaesthesia,\" he said. While there has been no official toll released, the BBC has confirmed with local hospitals that at least five people have died. Police say at least 500 protesters were arrested that night and are being held in police stations. The PTI claims some people are missing. And one person in particular hasn’t been seen in days: Bushra Bibi.\\n\\nThe next morning, the protesters were gone - leaving behind just wrecked cars and smashed glass\\n\\nOthers defended her. “It wasn’t her fault,” insisted another. “She was forced to leave by the party leaders.” Political commentators have been more scathing. “Her exit damaged her political career before it even started,” said Mehmal Sarfraz, a journalist and analyst. But was that even what she wanted? Khan has previously dismissed any thought his wife might have her own political ambitions - “she only conveys my messages,” he said in a statement attributed to him on his X account.\\n\\nImran Khan and Bushra Bibi, pictured here arriving at court in May 2023, married in 2018\\n\\nSpeaking to BBC Urdu, analyst Imtiaz Gul calls her participation “an extraordinary step in extraordinary circumstances\". Gul believes Bushra Bibi’s role today is only about “keeping the party and its workers active during Imran Khan’s absence”. It is a feeling echoed by some PTI members, who believe she is “stepping in only because Khan trusts her deeply”. Insiders, though, had often whispered that she was pulling the strings behind the scenes - advising her husband on political appointments and guiding high-stakes decisions during his tenure. A more direct intervention came for the first time earlier this month, when she urged a meeting of PTI leaders to back Khan’s call for a rally. Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif accused her of “opportunism”, claiming she sees “a future for herself as a political leader”. But Asma Faiz, an associate professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences, suspects the PTI’s leadership may have simply underestimated Bibi. “It was assumed that there was an understanding that she is a non-political person, hence she will not be a threat,” she told the AFP news agency. “However, the events of the last few days have shown a different side of Bushra Bibi.” But it probably doesn’t matter what analysts and politicians think. Many PTI supporters still see her as their connection to Imran Khan. It was clear her presence was enough to electrify the base. “She is the one who truly wants to get him out,” says Asim Ali, a resident of Islamabad. “I trust her. Absolutely!”', 'Walleys Quarry was ordered not to accept any new waste as of Friday\\n\\nA chemist and former senior lecturer in environmental sustainability has said powerful odours from a controversial landfill site may be linked to people doing more DIY during the Covid-19 pandemic. Complaints about Walleys Quarry in Silverdale, Staffordshire – which was ordered to close as of Friday – increased significantly during and after coronavirus lockdowns. Issuing the closure notice, the Environment Agency described management of the site as poor, adding it had exhausted all other enforcement tactics at premises where gases had been noxious and periodically above emission level guidelines - which some campaigners linked to ill health locally. Dr Sharon George, who used to teach at Keele University, said she had been to the site with students and found it to be clean and well-managed, and suggested an increase in plasterboard heading to landfills in 2020 could be behind a spike in stenches.\\n\\n“One of the materials that is particularly bad for producing odours and awful emissions is plasterboard,\" she said. “That’s one of the theories behind why Walleys Quarry got worse at that time.” She said the landfill was in a low-lying area, and that some of the gases that came from the site were quite heavy. “They react with water in the atmosphere, so some of the gases you smell can be quite awful and not very good for our health. “It’s why, on some days when it’s colder and muggy and a bit misty, you can smell it more.” Dr George added: “With any landfill, you’re putting things into the ground – and when you put things into the ground, if they can they will start to rot. When they start to rot they’re going to give off gases.” She believed Walleys Quarry’s proximity to people’s homes was another major factor in the amount of complaints that arose from its operation. “If you’ve got a gas that people can smell, they’re going to report it much more than perhaps a pollutant that might go unnoticed.”\\n\\nRebecca Currie said she did not think the site would ever be closed\\n\\nLocal resident and campaigner Rebecca Currie said the closure notice served to Walleys Quarry was \"absolutely amazing\". Her son Matthew has had breathing difficulties after being born prematurely with chronic lung disease, and Ms Currie says the site has made his symptoms worse. “I never thought this day was going to happen,” she explained. “We fought and fought for years.” She told BBC Midlands Today: “Our community have suffered. We\\'ve got kids who are really poorly, people have moved homes.”\\n\\nComplaints about Walleys Quarry to Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council exceeded 700 in November, the highest amount since 2021 according to council leader Simon Tagg. The Environment Agency (EA), which is responsible for regulating landfill sites, said it had concluded further operation at the site could result in \"significant long-term pollution\". A spokesperson for Walley\\'s Quarry Ltd said the firm rejected the EA\\'s accusations of poor management, and would be challenging the closure notice. Dr George said she believed the EA was likely to be erring on the side of caution and public safety, adding safety standards were strict. She said a lack of landfill space in the country overall was one of the broader issues that needed addressing. “As people, we just keep using stuff and then have nowhere to put it, and then when we end up putting it in places like Walleys Quarry that is next to houses, I think that’s where the problems are.”\\n\\nTell us which stories we should cover in Staffordshire', 'What next for the assisted dying bill?

    "# Creating Embeddings using Capella Model Service\n",
    "Embeddings are at the heart of semantic search. They are numerical representations of text that capture the semantic meaning of the words and phrases. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, which looks for exact matches, embeddings allow our search engine to understand the context and nuances of language, enabling it to retrieve documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact keywords. By creating embeddings using Capella Model service, we equip our RAG system with the ability to understand and process natural language in a way that is much closer to how humans understand language. This step transforms our raw text data into a format that the Capella vector store can use to find and rank relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the OpenAI Embeddings via the [LangChain OpenAI provider](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/openai/) with a few extra parameters specific to the Capella Model Services such as disabling the tokenization and handling of longer inputs using the LangChain handler. We provide the model and api_key and the URL for the SDK to those for Capella Model Services.

    "# Perform Semantic Search\n",
    "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the `similarity_search_with_score` method of the [CouchbaseSearchVectorStore](https://couchbase-ecosystem.github.io/langchain-couchbase/usage.html#couchbase-search-vector-store). This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

      "Manchester City are currently in relegation form and there is little sign of it ending. Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa left them joint bottom of the form table over the past eight games with just Southampton for company. Saints, at the foot of the Premier League, have the same number of points, four, as City over their past eight matches having won one, drawn one and lost six - the same record as the floundering champions. And if Southampton - who appointed Ivan Juric as their new manager on Saturday - get at least a point at Fulham on Sunday, City will be on the worst run in the division. Even Wolves, who sacked boss Gary O'Neil last Sunday and replaced him with Vitor Pereira, have earned double the number of points during the same period having played a game fewer. They are damning statistics for Pep Guardiola, even if he does have some mitigating circumstances with injuries to Ederson, Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias - who all missed the loss at Villa Park - and the long-term loss of midfield powerhouse Rodri. Guardiola was happy with Saturday's performance, despite defeat in Birmingham, but there is little solace to take at slipping further out of the title race. He may have needed to field a half-fit Manuel Akanji and John Stones at Villa Park but that does not account for City looking a shadow of their former selves. That does not justify the error Josko Gvardiol made to gift Jhon Duran a golden chance inside the first 20 seconds, or £100m man Jack Grealish again failing to have an impact on a game. There may be legitimate reasons for City's drop off, whether that be injuries, mental fatigue or just simply a team coming to the end of its lifecycle, but their form, which has plunged off a cliff edge, would have been unthinkable as they strolled to a fourth straight title last season. \"The worrying thing is the number of goals conceded,\" said ex-England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day. \"The number of times they were opened up because of the lack of protection and legs in midfield was staggering. There are so many things that are wrong at this moment in time.\"\n",

      "Afterwards Guardiola was calm, so much so it was difficult to hear him in the news conference, a contrast to the frustrated figure he cut on the touchline. He said: \"It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult. We are going to try next game - another opportunity and we don't think much further than that. \"Of course there are more reasons. We concede the goals we don't concede in the past, we [don't] score the goals we score in the past. Football is not just one reason. There are a lot of little factors. \"Last season we won the Premier League, but we came here and lost. We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys. Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back.\" Villa boss Unai Emery highlighted City's frailties, saying he felt Villa could seize on the visitors' lack of belief. \"Manchester City are a little bit under the confidence they have normally,\" he said. \"The second half was different, we dominated and we scored. Through those circumstances they were feeling worse than even in the first half.\"\n",

He told TNT after the game: \"Of course, [confidence levels are] not the best. We know how important confidence is and you can see that it affects every human being. That is how it is, we have to continue and stay positive even though it is difficult.\" Haaland, with 76 goals in 83 Premier League appearances since joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, had one shot and one touch in the Villa box. His 18 touches in the whole game were the lowest of all starting players and he has been self critical, despite scoring 13 goals in the top flight this season. Over City's last eight games he has netted just twice though, but Guardiola refused to criticise his star striker. He said: \"Without him we will be even worse but I like the players feeling that way. I don't agree with Erling. He needs to have the balls delivered in the right spots but he will fight for the next one.\"\n",

      "Pep Guardiola says his sleep has suffered during Manchester City's deepening crisis, so he will not be helped by a nightmarish conclusion to one of the most stunning defeats of his long reign. Guardiola looked agitated, animated and on edge even after City led the Manchester derby through Josko Gvardiol's 36th-minute header, his reaction to the goal one of almost disdain that it came via a deflected cross as opposed to in his purist style. He sat alone with his eyes closed sipping from a water bottle before the resumption of the second half, then was denied even the respite of victory when Manchester United gave this largely dismal derby a dramatic conclusion it barely deserved with a remarkable late comeback. First, with 88 minutes on the clock, Matheus Nunes presented Amad Diallo with the ball before compounding his error by flattening the forward as he made an attempt to recover his mistake. Bruno Fernandes completed the formalities from the penalty spot. Worse was to come two minutes later when Lisandro Martinez's routine long ball caught City's defence inexplicably statuesque. Goalkeeper Ederson's positioning was awry, allowing the lively Diallo to pounce from an acute angle to leave Guardiola and his players stunned. It was the latest into any game, 88 minutes, that reigning Premier League champions had led then lost. It was also the first time City had lost a game they were leading so late on. And in a sign of City's previous excellence that is now being challenged, they have only lost four of 105 Premier League home games under Guardiola in which they have been ahead at half-time, winning 94 and drawing seven. Guardiola delivered a brutal self-analysis as he told Match of the Day: \"I am not good enough. I am the boss. I am the manager. I have to find solutions and so far I haven't. That's the reality. \"Not much else to say. No defence. Manchester United were incredibly persistent. We have not lost eight games in two seasons. We can't defend that.\"\n",

      "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola in despair during the derby defeat to Manchester United\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardiola suggested the serious renewal will wait until the summer but the red flags have been appearing for weeks in the sudden and shocking decline of a team that has lost the aura of invincibility that left many opponents beaten before kick-off in previous years. He has had stated City must \"survive\" this season - whatever qualifies as survival for a club of such rich ambition - but the quest for a record fifth successive Premier League title is surely over as they lie nine points behind leaders Liverpool having played a game more. Their Champions League aspirations are also in jeopardy after another loss, this time against Juventus in Turin. City's squad has been allowed to grow too old together. The insatiable thirst for success seems to have gone, the scales of superiority have fallen away and opponents now sense vulnerability right until the final whistle, as United did here. The manner in which United were able, and felt able, to snatch this victory drove right to the heart of how City, and Guardiola, are allowing opponents to prey on their downfall. Guardiola has every reason to cite injuries, most significantly to Rodri and also John Stones as well as others, but this cannot be used an excuse for such a dramatic decline in standards, allied to the appearance of a soft underbelly that is so easily exploited. And City's rebuild will not be a quick fix. With every performance, every defeat, the scale of what lies in front of Guardiola becomes more obvious - and daunting. Manchester City's fans did their best to reassure Guardiola of their faith in him with a giant Barcelona-inspired banner draped from the stands before kick-off emblazoned with his image reading \"Més que un entrenador\" - \"More Than A Coach\". And Guardiola will now need to be more than a coach than at any time in his career. He will have the finances but it will be done with City's challengers also strengthening. Kevin de Bruyne, 34 in June, lasted 68 minutes here before he was substituted. Age and injuries are catching up with one of the greatest players of the Premier League era and he is unlikely to be at City next season. Mateo Kovacic, who replaced De Bruyne, is also 31 in May. Kyle Walker, 34, is being increasingly exposed. His most notable contribution here was an embarrassing collapse to the ground after the mildest head-to-head collision with Rasmus Hojlund. Ilkay Gundogan, another 34-year-old and a previous pillar of Guardiola's great successes, no longer has the legs or energy to exert influence. This looks increasingly like a season too far following his return from Barcelona. Flaws are also being exposed elsewhere, with previously reliable performers failing to hit previous standards. Phil Foden scored 27 goals and had 12 assists when he was Premier League Player of the Season last term. This year he has just three goals and two assists in 18 appearances in all competitions. He has no goals and just one assist in 11 Premier League games. Jack Grealish, who came on after 77 minutes against United, has not scored in a year for Manchester City, his last goal coming in a 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace on 16 December last year. He has, in the meantime, scored twice for England. Erling Haaland is also struggling as City lack creativity and cutting edge. He has three goals in his past 11 Premier League games after scoring 10 in his first five. And in another indication of City's impotence, and their reliance on Haaland, defender Gvardiol's goal against United was his fourth this season, making him their second highest scorer in all competitions behind the Norwegian striker, who has 18. Goalkeeper Ederson, so reliable for so long, has already been dropped once this season and did not cover himself in glory for United's winner. Guardiola, with that freshly signed two-year contract, insists he \"wants it\" as he treads on this alien territory of failure. He will be under no illusions about the size of the job in front of him as he placed his head in his hands in anguish after yet another damaging and deeply revealing defeat. City and Guardiola are in new, unforgiving territory.\n",

      "\n",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says he is \"fine\" despite admitting his sleep and diet are being affected by the worst run of results in his entire managerial career. In an interview with former Italy international Luca Toni for Amazon Prime Sport before Wednesday's Champions League defeat by Juventus, Guardiola touched on the personal impact City's sudden downturn in form has had. Guardiola said his state of mind was \"ugly\", that his sleep was \"worse\" and he was eating lighter as his digestion had suffered. City go into Sunday's derby against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium having won just one of their past 10 games. The Juventus loss means there is a chance they may not even secure a play-off spot in the Champions League. Asked to elaborate on his comments to Toni, Guardiola said: \"I'm fine. \"In our jobs we always want to do our best or the best as possible. When that doesn't happen you are more uncomfortable than when the situation is going well, always that happened. \"In good moments I am happier but when I get to the next game I am still concerned about what I have to do. There is no human being that makes an activity and it doesn't matter how they do.\" Guardiola said City have to defend better and \"avoid making mistakes at both ends\". To emphasise his point, Guardiola referred back to the third game of City's current run, against a Sporting side managed by Ruben Amorim, who will be in the United dugout at the weekend. City dominated the first half in Lisbon, led thanks to Phil Foden's early effort and looked to be cruising. Instead, they conceded three times in 11 minutes either side of half-time as Sporting eventually ran out 4-1 winners. \"I would like to play the game like we played in Lisbon on Sunday, believe me,\" said Guardiola, who is facing the prospect of only having three fit defenders for the derby as Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji try to overcome injury concerns. If there is solace for City, it comes from the knowledge United are not exactly flying. Their comeback Europa League victory against Viktoria Plzen on Thursday was their third win of Amorim's short reign so far but only one of those successes has come in the Premier League, where United have lost their past two games against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest. Nevertheless, Guardiola can see improvements already on the red side of the city. \"It's already there,\" he said. \"You see all the patterns, the movements, the runners and the pace. He will do a good job at United, I'm pretty sure of that.\"\n",

      "Guardiola says skipper Kyle Walker has been offered support by the club after the City defender highlighted the racial abuse he had received on social media in the wake of the Juventus trip. \"It's unacceptable,\" he said. \"Not because it's Kyle - for any human being. \"Unfortunately it happens many times in the real world. It is not necessary to say he has the support of the entire club. It is completely unacceptable and we give our support to him.\"\n",

      "Pep Guardiola's Man City have lost nine of their past 12 matches\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardiola has also been giving it a lot of thought. He has not been sleeping very well, as he has said, and has not been himself at times when talking to the media. He has been talking to a lot of people about what is going on as he tries to work out the reasons for City's demise. Some reasons he knows, others he still doesn't. What people perhaps do not realise is Guardiola hugely doubts himself and always has. He will be thinking \"I'm not going to be able to get us out of this\" and needs the support of people close to him to push away those insecurities - and he has that. He is protected by his people who are very aware, like he is, that there are a lot of people that want City to fail. It has been a turbulent time for Guardiola. Remember those marks he had on his head after the 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the Champions League? He always scratches his head, it is a gesture of nervousness. Normally nothing happens but on that day one of his nails was far too sharp so, after talking to the players in the changing room where he scratched his head because of his usual agitated gesturing, he went to the news conference. His right-hand man Manel Estiarte sent him photos in a message saying \"what have you got on your head?\", but by the time Guardiola returned to the coaching room there was hardly anything there again. He started that day with a cover on his nose after the same thing happened at the training ground the day before. Guardiola was having a footballing debate with Kyle Walker about positional stuff and marked his nose with that same nail. There was also that remarkable news conference after the Manchester derby when he said \"I don't know what to do\". That is partly true and partly not true. Ignore the fact Guardiola suggested he was \"not good enough\". He actually meant he was not good enough to resolve the situation with the group of players he has available and with all the other current difficulties. There are obviously logical explanations for the crisis and the first one has been talked about many times - the absence of injured midfielder Rodri. You know the game Jenga? When you take the wrong piece out, the whole tower collapses. That is what has happened here. It is normal for teams to have an over-reliance on one player if he is the best in the world in his position. And you cannot calculate the consequences of an injury that rules someone like Rodri out for the season. City are a team, like many modern ones, in which the holding midfielder is a key element to the construction. So, when you take Rodri out, it is difficult to hold it together. There were Plan Bs - John Stones, Manuel Akanji, even Nathan Ake - but injuries struck. The big injury list has been out of the ordinary and the busy calendar has also played a part in compounding the issues. However, one factor even Guardiola cannot explain is the big uncharacteristic errors in almost every game from international players. Why did Matheus Nunes make that challenge to give away the penalty against Manchester United? Jack Grealish is sent on at the end to keep the ball and cannot do that. There are errors from Walker and other defenders. These are some of the best players in the world. Of course the players' mindset is important, and confidence is diminishing. Wrong decisions get taken so there is almost panic on the pitch instead of calm. There are also players badly out of form who are having to play because of injuries. Walker is now unable to hide behind his pace, I'm not sure Kevin de Bruyne is ever getting back to the level he used to be at, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan do not have time to rest, Grealish is not playing at his best. Some of these players were only meant to be playing one game a week but, because of injuries, have played 12 games in 40 days. It all has a domino effect. One consequence is that Erling Haaland isn't getting the service to score. But the Norwegian still remains City's top-scorer with 13. Defender Josko Gvardiol is next on the list with just four. The way their form has been analysed inside the City camp is there have only been three games where they deserved to lose (Liverpool, Bournemouth and Aston Villa). But of course it is time to change the dynamic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardiola has never protected his players so much. He has not criticised them and is not going to do so. They have won everything with him. Instead of doing more with them, he has tried doing less. He has sometimes given them more days off to clear their heads, so they can reset - two days this week for instance. Perhaps the time to change a team is when you are winning, but no-one was suggesting Man City were about to collapse when they were top and unbeaten after nine league games. Some people have asked how bad it has to get before City make a decision on Guardiola. The answer is that there is no decision to be made. Maybe if this was Real Madrid, Barcelona or Juventus, the pressure from outside would be massive and the argument would be made that Guardiola has to go. At City he has won the lot, so how can anyone say he is failing? Yes, this is a crisis. But given all their problems, City's renewed target is finishing in the top four. That is what is in all their heads now. The idea is to recover their essence by improving defensive concepts that are not there and re-establishing the intensity they are known for. Guardiola is planning to use the next two years of his contract, which is expected to be his last as a club manager, to prepare a new Manchester City. When he was at the end of his four years at Barcelona, he asked two managers what to do when you feel people are not responding to your instructions. Do you go or do the players go? Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafael Benitez both told him that the players need to go. Guardiola did not listen because of his emotional attachment to his players back then and he decided to leave the Camp Nou because he felt the cycle was over. He will still protect his players now but there is not the same emotional attachment - so it is the players who are going to leave this time. It is likely City will look to replace five or six regular starters. Guardiola knows it is the end of an era and the start of a new one. Changes will not be immediate and the majority of the work will be done in the summer. But they are open to any opportunities in January - and a holding midfielder is one thing they need. In the summer City might want to get Spain's Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and they know 60m euros (£50m) will get him. He said no to Liverpool last summer even though everything was agreed, but he now wants to move on and the Premier League is the target. Even if they do not get Zubimendi, that is the calibre of footballer they are after. A new Manchester City is on its way - with changes driven by Guardiola, incoming sporting director Hugo Viana and the football department.\n",

    "# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Couchbase and Langchain\n",
    "Couchbase and LangChain can be seamlessly integrated to create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chains, enhancing the process of generating contextually relevant responses. In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a large language model using LangChain.\n",

    "The language model, equipped with the context from the retrieved documents, generates a response that is both informed and contextually accurate. This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase’s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while the LLM handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation."
