title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Couchbase and OpenRouter Deepseek using GSI index
short_title: RAG with Couchbase and OpenRouter Deepseek using GSI index
description:
  - Learn how to build a semantic search engine using Couchbase and OpenRouter with Deepseek using GSI index.
  - This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Couchbase's vector search capabilities with OpenRouter Deepseek as both embeddings and language model provider.
  - You'll understand how to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and Couchbase.
