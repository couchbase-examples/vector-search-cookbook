    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Deepseek V3 as the language model provider (via OpenRouter or direct API)](https://deepseek.ai/) and OpenAI for embeddings. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using the Search Vector Index from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the Hyperscale or Composite Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-openrouter-deepseek-with-hyperscale-or-composite-vector-index/)"
