title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenRouter Deepseek and Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index
short_title: RAG with OpenRouter Deepseek and Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index
description:
  - Learn how to build a semantic search engine using OpenRouter Deepseek and Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index.
  - This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Couchbase's Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index capabilities with OpenRouter Deepseek as both embeddings and language model provider.
  - You'll understand how to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, OpenRouter Deepseek, and Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index.
  - Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the Search Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-openrouter-deepseek-with-search-vector-index/)
