We can create either multiple such functions, or a single function with collection name passed as parameter to offer varied results based on use case.\n",

In the near term, every \\\\nregion in the world is projected to face further increases in \\\\nclimate hazards ( medium to high conﬁdence, depending on \\\\nregion and hazard), increasing multiple risks to ecosystems \\\\nand humans ( very high conﬁdence ). In the near term, natural \\\\nvariability149 will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating \\\\nor amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little \\\\neffect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important \\\\nto consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any \\\\nsingle year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced \\\\ntrend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature \\\\nin any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a \\\\nprobability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed \\\\nin WGI (medium confidence ). The occurrence of individual years with \\\\nglobal surface temperature change above a certain level does not \\\\nimply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large \\\\nexplosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near term 150 , it \\\\nwould temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change \\\\nby reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially\\\\n[Search Result 2] Global warming will continue to increase in the near term in \\\\nnearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Deep, \\\\nrapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions, reaching net \\\\nzero CO2 emissions and including strong emissions reductions \\\\nof other GHGs, in particular CH4, are necessary to limit warming \\\\nto 1.5°C (>50%) or less  than 2°C (>67%) by the end of century \\\\n(high conﬁdence ). The best estimate of reaching 1.5°C of global \\\\nwarming lies in the ﬁrst half  of the 2030s in most of the considered \\\\nscenarios and modelled pathways114. In the very low GHG emissions \\\\nscenario ( SSP1-1.9), CO2 emissions reach net zero around 2050 and the \\\\nbest-estimate end-of-century warming is 1.4°C, after a temporary overshoot \\\\n(see Section 3.3.4) of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming. \\\\nGlobal warming of 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless \\\\ndeep reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions occur in the coming \\\\ndecades. Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG emissions would \\\\nlead to improvements in air quality within a few years, to reductions in \\\\ntrends of global surface temperature discernible after around 20 years, \\\\nand over longer time periods for many other climate impact-drivers 115 \\\\n(high conﬁdence ). Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead \\\\nto more rapid improvements in air quality compared to reductions \\\\nin GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are\\\\n[Search Result 3] and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue \\\\nto increase beyond 2100 ( high conﬁdence ). At sustained warming \\\\nlevels between 2°C and 3°C,  the Greenland and West Antarctic ice \\\\nsheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple \\\\nmillennia (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss \\\\nincrease with higher global surface temperatures ( high conﬁdence ). \\\\nOver the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about \\\\n2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C \\\\n(low conﬁdence). Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level \\\\nrise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate \\\\nperiods: global mean sea level was very likely 5 to 25 m higher than today \\\\nroughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C to \\\\n4°C higher than 1850–1900 ( medium conﬁdence ).
