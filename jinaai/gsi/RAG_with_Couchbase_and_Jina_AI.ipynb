    "\n",
    "**Hyperscale Vector Indexes (BHIVE):**\n",
    "- **Best for**: Pure vector searches - content discovery, recommendations, semantic search\n",
    "- **Performance**: High performance with low memory footprint, designed to scale to billions of vectors\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Optimized for concurrent operations, supports simultaneous searches and inserts\n",
    "- **Use when**: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering\n",
    "- **Ideal for**: Large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, content discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composite Vector Indexes:**\n",
    "- **Best for**: Filtered vector searches that combine vector search with scalar value filtering\n",
    "- **Performance**: Efficient pre-filtering where scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope\n",
    "- **Use when**: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data\n",
    "- **Ideal for**: Compliance-based filtering, user-specific searches, time-bounded queries\n",
    "- **Note**: Scalar filters take precedence over vector similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Right Index Type:**\n",
    "- Start with Hyperscale Vector Index for pure vector searches and large datasets\n",
    "- Use Composite Vector Index when scalar filters significantly reduce your search space\n",
    "- Consider your dataset size: Hyperscale scales to billions, Composite works well for tens of millions to billions\n",

    "**Format**: `'IVF[<centroids>],{PQ|SQ}<settings>'`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **IVF (Inverted File Index) - Centroids Configuration**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Controls how the dataset is subdivided into clusters for faster searches\n",
    "- **Trade-offs**: More centroids = faster searches but slower training time\n",
    "- **Auto-selection**: If omitted (e.g., `IVF,SQ8`), Couchbase automatically selects the optimal number based on dataset size\n",
    "- **Manual setting**: Specify exact count (e.g., `IVF1000,SQ8` for 1000 centroids)\n",

    "#### **Quantization Options - Vector Compression**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Settings**: `SQ4`, `SQ6`, `SQ8` (4-bit, 6-bit, 8-bit precision)\n",
    "- **Trade-off**: Lower bits = more compression but less precision\n",
    "- **Best for**: General-purpose applications where some precision loss is acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "**PQ (Product Quantization)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Advanced compression using subquantizers for better precision\n",
    "- **Format**: `PQ<subquantizers>x<bits>` (e.g., `PQ32x8` = 32 subquantizers of 8 bits each)\n",
    "- **Trade-off**: More complex but often better precision than SQ at similar compression ratios\n",
    "- **Best for**: Applications requiring high precision with significant compression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Common Configuration Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "IVF,SQ8          # Auto-selected centroids with 8-bit scalar quantization (recommended default)\n",
    "IVF1000,SQ6      # 1000 centroids with 6-bit scalar quantization (higher compression)\n",
    "IVF,PQ32x8       # Auto-selected centroids with 32 subquantizers of 8 bits each\n",
    "IVF500,PQ16x4    # 500 centroids with 16 subquantizers of 4 bits each (high compression)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Performance Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distance Interpretation**: In GSI vector search, lower distance values indicate higher similarity, while higher distance values indicate lower similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability**: BHIVE indexes can scale to billions of vectors with optimized concurrent operations, making them suitable for large-scale production deployments.\n",
