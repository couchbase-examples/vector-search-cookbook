        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Jina](https://jina.ai/) as the AI-powered embedding and language model provider, utilizing Full-Text Search (FTS). Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the GSI index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-jina-couchbase-rag-with-global-secondary-index)"

        "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseSearchVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Note on Retry Mechanism\n",
        "The search implementation includes a retry mechanism to handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully. If a rate limit error (HTTP 429) is encountered, the system will automatically retry the request up to 3 times with exponential backoff, waiting 2 seconds initially and doubling the wait time between each retry. This helps manage API usage limits while maintaining service reliability. For other types of errors, such as payment requirements or general failures, appropriate error messages and troubleshooting steps are provided to help diagnose and resolve the issue."

He has been talking to a lot of people about what is going on as he tries to work out the reasons for City's demise. Some reasons he knows, others he still doesn't. What people perhaps do not realise is Guardiola hugely doubts himself and always has. He will be thinking \"I'm not going to be able to get us out of this\" and needs the support of people close to him to push away those insecurities - and he has that. He is protected by his people who are very aware, like he is, that there are a lot of people that want City to fail. It has been a turbulent time for Guardiola. Remember those marks he had on his head after the 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the Champions League? He always scratches his head, it is a gesture of nervousness. Normally nothing happens but on that day one of his nails was far too sharp so, after talking to the players in the changing room where he scratched his head because of his usual agitated gesturing, he went to the news conference. His right-hand man Manel Estiarte sent him photos in a message saying \"what have you got on your head?\", but by the time Guardiola returned to the coaching room there was hardly anything there again. He started that day with a cover on his nose after the same thing happened at the training ground the day before. Guardiola was having a footballing debate with Kyle Walker about positional stuff and marked his nose with that same nail. There was also that remarkable news conference after the Manchester derby when he said \"I don't know what to do\". That is partly true and partly not true. Ignore the fact Guardiola suggested he was \"not good enough\". He actually meant he was not good enough to resolve the situation with the group of players he has available and with all the other current difficulties. There are obviously logical explanations for the crisis and the first one has been talked about many times - the absence of injured midfielder Rodri. You know the game Jenga? When you take the wrong piece out, the whole tower collapses. That is what has happened here. It is normal for teams to have an over-reliance on one player if he is the best in the world in his position. And you cannot calculate the consequences of an injury that rules someone like Rodri out for the season. City are a team, like many modern ones, in which the holding midfielder is a key element to the construction. So, when you take Rodri out, it is difficult to hold it together. There were Plan Bs - John Stones, Manuel Akanji, even Nathan Ake - but injuries struck. The big injury list has been out of the ordinary and the busy calendar has also played a part in compounding the issues. However, one factor even Guardiola cannot explain is the big uncharacteristic errors in almost every game from international players. Why did Matheus Nunes make that challenge to give away the penalty against Manchester United? Jack Grealish is sent on at the end to keep the ball and cannot do that. There are errors from Walker and other defenders. These are some of the best players in the world. Of course the players' mindset is important, and confidence is diminishing. Wrong decisions get taken so there is almost panic on the pitch instead of calm. There are also players badly out of form who are having to play because of injuries. Walker is now unable to hide behind his pace, I'm not sure Kevin de Bruyne is ever getting back to the level he used to be at, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan do not have time to rest, Grealish is not playing at his best. Some of these players were only meant to be playing one game a week but, because of injuries, have played 12 games in 40 days. It all has a domino effect. One consequence is that Erling Haaland isn't getting the service to score. But the Norwegian still remains City's top-scorer with 13. Defender Josko Gvardiol is next on the list with just four. The way their form has been analysed inside the City camp is there have only been three games where they deserved to lose (Liverpool, Bournemouth and Aston Villa).

            "Guardiola has never protected his players so much. He has not criticised them and is not going to do so. They have won everything with him. Instead of doing more with them, he has tried doing less. He has sometimes given them more days off to clear their heads, so they can reset - two days this week for instance. Perhaps the time to change a team is when you are winning, but no-one was suggesting Man City were about to collapse when they were top and unbeaten after nine league games. Some people have asked how bad it has to get before City make a decision on Guardiola. The answer is that there is no decision to be made. Maybe if this was Real Madrid, Barcelona or Juventus, the pressure from outside would be massive and the argument would be made that Guardiola has to go. At City he has won the lot, so how can anyone say he is failing? Yes, this is a crisis. But given all their problems, City's renewed target is finishing in the top four. That is what is in all their heads now. The idea is to recover their essence by improving defensive concepts that are not there and re-establishing the intensity they are known for. Guardiola is planning to use the next two years of his contract, which is expected to be his last as a club manager, to prepare a new Manchester City. When he was at the end of his four years at Barcelona, he asked two managers what to do when you feel people are not responding to your instructions. Do you go or do the players go? Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafael Benitez both told him that the players need to go. Guardiola did not listen because of his emotional attachment to his players back then and he decided to leave the Camp Nou because he felt the cycle was over. He will still protect his players now but there is not the same emotional attachment - so it is the players who are going to leave this time. It is likely City will look to replace five or six regular starters. Guardiola knows it is the end of an era and the start of a new one. Changes will not be immediate and the majority of the work will be done in the summer. But they are open to any opportunities in January - and a holding midfielder is one thing they need. In the summer City might want to get Spain's Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and they know 60m euros (£50m) will get him. He said no to Liverpool last summer even though everything was agreed, but he now wants to move on and the Premier League is the target. Even if they do not get Zubimendi, that is the calibre of footballer they are after.

            "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says he is \"fine\" despite admitting his sleep and diet are being affected by the worst run of results in his entire managerial career. In an interview with former Italy international Luca Toni for Amazon Prime Sport before Wednesday's Champions League defeat by Juventus, Guardiola touched on the personal impact City's sudden downturn in form has had. Guardiola said his state of mind was \"ugly\", that his sleep was \"worse\" and he was eating lighter as his digestion had suffered. City go into Sunday's derby against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium having won just one of their past 10 games. The Juventus loss means there is a chance they may not even secure a play-off spot in the Champions League. Asked to elaborate on his comments to Toni, Guardiola said: \"I'm fine. \"In our jobs we always want to do our best or the best as possible. When that doesn't happen you are more uncomfortable than when the situation is going well, always that happened. \"In good moments I am happier but when I get to the next game I am still concerned about what I have to do. There is no human being that makes an activity and it doesn't matter how they do.\" Guardiola said City have to defend better and \"avoid making mistakes at both ends\". To emphasise his point, Guardiola referred back to the third game of City's current run, against a Sporting side managed by Ruben Amorim, who will be in the United dugout at the weekend. City dominated the first half in Lisbon, led thanks to Phil Foden's early effort and looked to be cruising. Instead, they conceded three times in 11 minutes either side of half-time as Sporting eventually ran out 4-1 winners. \"I would like to play the game like we played in Lisbon on Sunday, believe me,\" said Guardiola, who is facing the prospect of only having three fit defenders for the derby as Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji try to overcome injury concerns. If there is solace for City, it comes from the knowledge United are not exactly flying. Their comeback Europa League victory against Viktoria Plzen on Thursday was their third win of Amorim's short reign so far but only one of those successes has come in the Premier League, where United have lost their past two games against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest. Nevertheless, Guardiola can see improvements already on the red side of the city. \"It's already there,\" he said. \"You see all the patterns, the movements, the runners and the pace. He will do a good job at United, I'm pretty sure of that.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Guardiola says skipper Kyle Walker has been offered support by the club after the City defender highlighted the racial abuse he had received on social media in the wake of the Juventus trip. \"It's unacceptable,\" he said. \"Not because it's Kyle - for any human being. \"Unfortunately it happens many times in the real world. It is not necessary to say he has the support of the entire club. It is completely unacceptable and we give our support to him.\"\n",

            "\"We have entirely changed the way we think about football,\" a buoyant Cristiano Giuntoli told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera at the start of the season. \"We started from scratch. We are discovering ourselves and we are curious to see what we can achieve,\" the Juventus sporting director added. 'Make the Old Lady young again' was the remit - and that's what Giuntoli did. Massimiliano Allegri might have treated us to a bizarre striptease as Juventus lifted the Coppa Italia trophy last season, but his antiquated tactics were shown the door and in came Thiago Motta, the young and upcoming coach who revived Bologna with his stylish vision of the game. Just shy of 200m euros was splashed on the market to bring in the likes of Atalanta's Teun Koopmeiners and Aston Villa's Douglas Luiz. The midfield was injected with fresh new talent and youngsters were promoted and immediately thrown on to the pitch to dazzling effect, at least in the early games of the season. It all began so well. Juventus collected two consecutive league victories, winning 3-0 in both, defeated PSV and RB Leipzig in the Champions League, and most importantly they had an identifiable style of play - something that hadn't been witnessed under Allegri. The team were attacking in nature, aggressive as they won possession high up the pitch and positional fluidity was the name of the game. And then it all started to fall apart.\n",

            "\n",
            "Fifteen matches in and Juventus find themselves in sixth place in Serie A, still unbeaten in the league but incapable of a win. They may boast the strongest defence but their attacking game risks being advertised as a cure for insomnia. Drab, laborious and dreadfully predictable, the Bianconeri promised change but seem to be delivering much of the same, with fewer positive results. At this stage of the season last year, Allegri's Juventus were second in the table with nine points more. They may not have entertained but they were at least winning. Seven draws in their past nine games under Motta and the fans have started to lose patience, jeering and booing the squad in the second half of the match against Bologna last weekend. Juve were down 2-0 before staging a comeback to level the score. Another draw. Without Allegri, critics are stumped as to who to blame for Juve's current crisis - and yes, it is a crisis. Dusan Vlahovic, when available, still can't score goals consistently. Koopmeiners, who helped push Atalanta to a trophy last season, looks like a shadow of himself, playing in a position that has seemingly robbed him of his superpowers and highlighted his limitations. And Douglas Luiz? There's already talk of shipping him back to England.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's still early in the season to cast wild judgements. However, Motta has made some curious decisions that have attracted scrutiny. For example, his insistence on not playing Kenan Yildiz, the magical number 10, in the middle behind the striker - a position where he thrived in the early games of the season. Shunted out wide, the youngster has struggled to make a consistent impact. Meanwhile, Vlahovic's performances continue to spark debate. When the Serbian striker failed to replicate his form for Fiorentina at Juventus, it was difficult not to blame Allegri's defensive tactics for his apparent regression. Exhibiting more of the same mediocrity this season and Vlahovic was soon heard taking aim at his new coach while out for international duty with Serbia. \"It is a bit easier for me when there is another striker, because Mitrovic holds up the ball and engages in aerial duels, so I can make more of my own characteristics and qualities,\" he said. \"The coach also does not require many defensive duties from me, so that makes it easier too. With my physicality, I can't really run that much and am not as fresh in my finishing when I've been working so hard.\" So the Serbian wants total freedom at a club that requires a team effort to start winning again? Motta will not be giving up on Vlahovic and Juve will not give up on Motta any time soon. Both the directors and the fans - even the ones who boo - have a lot of faith in their new coach. Against Empoli, a 0-0 draw, the media noted that Motta's substitutions nearly cost the team a defeat as they began to allow the opposition's counter-attacks. Against Napoli, it was argued Juve can only win against sides that leave gaps at the back. When the Old Lady won the next match against Genoa 3-0, Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport criticised the endless tinkering, asking if Motta was throwing on the kids to 'surprise' when he ought be concentrating on establishing a starting XI. Against Lecce - how could he introduce youth when they were holding on to a 1-0 victory? That's the time for experience, journalists argued.\n",

This is a squad with an injury crisis so deep they only had four outfield players available on the bench in the Champions League match against Aston Villa. Who can be expected to revolutionise a club's playing style, incorporate new arrivals and develop youngsters when he's too busy simply looking for bodies to field on the pitch? Congested fixture lists have meant injuries are a common problem among the big European clubs, and while the coach's physical preparation of the side must always be examined and re-examined, it's worth nothing Juve have often had to deal with a mounting injury list. What ought to be discussed is why Juventus had three strikers in the squad when they were out of European competition but believed Vlahovic and Arkadiusz Milik - who has been seriously injured since June - were enough for a team partaking in four competitions this season. Giuntoli must answer for the decisions. Selling Moise Kean, who has already scored 13 goals for Fiorentina, without replacing him seems to have been a naive move that has cost Juve in this early stage of the season. Allegri is said to have privately believed Kean to be better than Vlahovic. Even more curious is the decision to invest in injury-prone Nico Gonzalez, who has only managed 226 minutes thus far due to injuries. The best ability is availability, and one would have thought Juventus had realised that when they chose to let go of both Paulo Dybala and Federico Chiesa who previously produced much more in Serie A. Against Manchester City, Juventus will face a team suffering a similar crisis with both coaches trying to manage expectations. Another draw or loss for the Old Lady and it will be difficult not to suspect Juve 2.0 are really just a lot like Allegri's originals.\n",

            "\n",
            "Manchester City striker Erling Haaland has now missed two of his 17 penalties taken in the Premier League\n",
            "\n",
            "Nothing seems to be going Manchester City's way at the moment - and star striker Erling Haaland is not a happy man. If there was any player currently in the Premier League you would hand the ball to for a penalty to win a match, it would be the prolific Norwegian. Not on this occasion, though. Looking to land a knockout blow, Haaland saw his second-half strike saved by spot-kick expert Jordan Pickford, as Manchester City's crisis continued with a 1-1 draw against Everton at Etihad Stadium. \"How do you react mentally?\" asked boss Pep Guardiola about the penalty miss. \"Life is not easy. Sport is not easy. When it happens, it is OK. \"There are still a lot of minutes to play and we had the chances afterwards. We created, incredible how they ran and fight. In some games it was not good but today well played.\" At the full-time whistle, there were a smattering of boos from home supporters at Etihad Stadium and a despondent Haaland ripped off his hair bobble and shirt before heading straight down the tunnel. As Haaland trudged off out of sight, Guardiola stood motionless on the pitch with the look of a man unable to find answers to their current crisis. City's all-conquering side have suffered a remarkable drop-off and now won just once in their last 13 games in all competitions. In the post-match news conference, the stunned Spaniard was barely audible in the responses to the questions fired his way. \"My body language was positive,\" he uttered. \"The team played really good. We had I don't know how many shots. The first half was brilliant.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "City have a lengthy injury list, but their downturn has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal. The striker made a blistering start to the campaign looked to be on his way to setting more goalscoring records when netting 10 goals in his first five games, but has only managed three in 13 since. This has largely been down to underperformance on his expected goal (xG) rate, with statistics showing he has scored five fewer goals than he should have done during this recent run. There is also a stark contrast from his shot conversion rate from the first five games to his last 13, dropping from 38.5% to a lowly 6.4%. The penalty miss was Haaland's only shot on target in the contest - but Everton did not set out to pay him extra attention. Asked if there had been a special plan to handle the frontman, Dyche said: \"No. I was asked the other day when playing Chelsea about Cole Palmer and what a great player he is turning out to be. \"We know Haaland is too but I believe in the team. I don't look at one aspect of it, I look at the team, what they are doing and they have done a good job today.\"\n",

            "Pickford saved his seventh penalty in the Premier League since joining Everton in 2017\n",
            "\n",
            "After Toffees forward Iliman Ndiaye had cancelled out Bernardo Silva's opener, the defining moment came in the second half when Vitalii Mykolenko tripped Savinho in the box. During the VAR check, it was a battle of the minds with Everton captain Seamus Coleman receiving a yellow card for trying to put off Haaland, who had the ball in his hand. The booking ultimately appeared to be a well-earned one for the team and Pickford seemed to revel in his big moment, jumping up and down on his line, sticking his tongue out before stooping low to his right to push the ball away. Pickford has made big penalty saves for England on the international stage and this was seventh spot-kick stop since joining Everton in 2017. Such is City's luck at the moment that they managed to recycle the ball and Haaland headed in, but it was ruled out for offside, much to the joy of the travelling supporters. Haaland had scored 15 of 16 of his previous penalties in the league, with the other hitting the woodwork, while this was the first he had seen saved. \"It is good from the analysts to give him as much benefit of as many penalties as they can,\" Dyche said of Pickford's save. \"Credit to him for making the right decision in the spur of the moment.\" Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Pickford is good at putting pressure on strikers. Haaland must have felt the pressure there, this place went silent. \"It was a decent save but a really poor penalty. He didn't whip it around like a left-footer should. A poor penalty, but a good save.\" Ex-England defender Matt Upson added on Amazon Prime: \"It was brilliant save from Pickford. He relishes situations like this. He doesn't make life any easier for the penalty taker. \"But for Haaland to miss that penalty speaks a bit about where the confidence is in this team at the moment.\"\n",
