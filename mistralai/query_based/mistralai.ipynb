    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) as the AI-powered embedding Model. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch. Alternatively, if you want to perform semantic search using the Search Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-mistralai-couchbase-vector-search-with-search-vector-index)\n",
    "\n",
    "Couchbase is a NoSQL distributed document database (JSON) with many of the best features of a relational DBMS: SQL, distributed ACID transactions, and much more. [Couchbase Capella™](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up) is the easiest way to get started, but you can also download and run [Couchbase Server](http://couchbase.com/downloads) on-premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral AI is a research lab building the best open source models in the world. La Plateforme enables developers and enterprises to build new products and applications, powered by Mistral's open source and commercial LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Mistral AI APIs](https://console.mistral.ai/) empower LLM applications via:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Text generation](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/completion/), enables streaming and provides the ability to display partial model results in real-time\n",
    "- [Code generation](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/code_generation/), empowers code generation tasks, including fill-in-the-middle and code completion\n",
    "- [Embeddings](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/embeddings/), useful for RAG where it represents the meaning of text as a list of numbers\n",
    "- [Function calling](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/function_calling/), enables Mistral models to connect to external tools\n",
    "- [Fine-tuning](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/finetuning/), enables developers to create customized and specialized models\n",
    "- [JSON mode](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/json_mode/), enables developers to set the response format to json_object\n",
    "- [Guardrailing](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/guardrailing/), enables developers to enforce policies at the system level of Mistral models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use Mistral AI's embedding capabilities with Couchbase's **Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes** for optimized vector search operations. Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes provide superior performance for vector operations compared to traditional search methods, especially for large-scale applications.\n"

    "#### Vector Index Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Couchbase offers two distinct query-based vector index types, each optimized for different use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hyperscale Vector Indexes \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best for**: Pure vector searches like content discovery, recommendations, and semantic search\n",
    "- **Use when**: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering\n",
    "- **Features**: \n",
    "  - High performance with low memory footprint\n",
    "  - Optimized for concurrent operations\n",
    "  - Designed to scale to billions of vectors\n",
    "  - Supports post-scan filtering for basic metadata filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Composite Vector Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Best for**: Filtered vector searches that combine vector similarity with scalar value filtering\n",
    "- **Use when**: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data\n",
    "- **Features**: \n",
    "  - Efficient pre-filtering where scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope\n",
    "  - Best for well-defined workloads requiring complex filtering using Composite Vector Index features\n",
    "  - Supports range lookups combined with vector search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index Type Selection for This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate creating a **Hyperscale Vector Index** and running vector similarity queries. Hyperscale Vector Index is ideal for semantic search scenarios where you want:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-performance vector search** across large datasets\n",
    "2. **Low latency** for real-time applications\n",
    "3. **Scalability** to handle growing vector collections\n",
    "4. **Concurrent operations** for multi-user environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hyperscale Vector Index will provide optimal performance for our OpenAI embedding-based semantic search implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative: Composite Vector Index\n",
    "\n",
    "If your use case requires complex filtering with scalar attributes, you may want to consider using a **Composite Vector Index** instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## Alternative: Create a Composite index for filtered searches\n",
    "vector_store.create_index(\n",
    "    index_type=IndexType.COMPOSITE,\n",
    "    index_description=\"IVF,SQ8\",\n",
    "    distance_metric=DistanceStrategy.COSINE,\n",
    "    index_name=\"pydantic_composite_index\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Composite indexes when:**\n",
    "- You need to filter by document metadata or attributes before vector similarity\n",
    "- Your queries combine vector search with WHERE clauses\n",
    "- You have well-defined filtering requirements that can reduce the search space\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Composite indexes enable pre-filtering with scalar attributes, making them ideal for applications where you need to search within specific categories, date ranges, or user-specific data segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Index Configuration (Couchbase 8.0 Feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating our Hyperscale index, it's important to understand the configuration parameters that optimize vector storage and search performance. The `index_description` parameter controls how Couchbase optimizes vector storage through centroids and quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Index Description Format: `'IVF[<centroids>],{PQ|SQ}<settings>'`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Centroids (IVF - Inverted File)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Controls how the dataset is subdivided for faster searches\n",
    "- **More centroids** = faster search, slower training time\n",
    "- **Fewer centroids** = slower search, faster training time\n",
    "- If omitted (like `IVF,SQ8`), Couchbase auto-selects based on dataset size\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Quantization Options\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalar Quantization (SQ):**\n",
    "- `SQ4`, `SQ6`, `SQ8` (4, 6, or 8 bits per dimension)\n",
    "- Lower memory usage, faster search, slightly reduced accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Product Quantization (PQ):**\n",
    "- Format: `PQ<subquantizers>x<bits>` (e.g., `PQ32x8`)\n",
    "- Better compression for very large datasets\n",
    "- More complex but can maintain accuracy with smaller index size\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common Configuration Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`IVF,SQ8`** - Auto centroids, 8-bit scalar quantization (good default)\n",
    "- **`IVF1000,SQ6`** - 1000 centroids, 6-bit scalar quantization\n",
    "- **`IVF,PQ32x8`** - Auto centroids, 32 subquantizers with 8 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed configuration options, see the [Quantization & Centroid Settings](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/hyperscale-vector-index.html#algo_settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes, see [Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes Documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/use-vector-indexes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Our Configuration Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use `IVF,SQ8` which provides:\n",
    "- **Auto-selected centroids** optimized for our dataset size\n",
    "- **8-bit scalar quantization** for good balance of speed, memory usage, and accuracy\n",
    "- **COSINE distance metric** ideal for semantic similarity search\n",
    "- **Optimal performance** for most semantic search use cases"

    "## Understanding Semantic Search in Couchbase\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search goes beyond traditional keyword matching by understanding the meaning and context behind queries. Here's how it works in Couchbase:\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Semantic Search Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Embeddings**: Documents and queries are converted into high-dimensional vectors using an embeddings model (in our case, Mistral AI's mistral-embed)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Similarity Calculation**: When a query is made, Couchbase compares the query vector against stored document vectors using the COSINE distance metric\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Ranking**: Documents are ranked by their vector distance (lower distance = more similar meaning)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible Configuration**: Different distance metrics (cosine, euclidean, dot product) and embedding models can be used based on your needs\n",
    "\n",
    "The `similarity_search_with_score` method performs this entire process, returning documents along with their similarity scores. This enables you to find semantically related content even when exact keywords don't match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see semantic search in action and measure its performance with different optimization strategies.\n"
