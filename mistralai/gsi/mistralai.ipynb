        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database, [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) as the AI-powered embedding Model. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch. Alternatively, if you want to perform semantic search using the FTS, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-mistralai-couchbase-vector-search-with-fts)\n",
