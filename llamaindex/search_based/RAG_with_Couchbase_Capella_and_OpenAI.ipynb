    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Couchbase Capella as the database, [gpt-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o) model as the large language model provided by OpenAI. We will use the [text-embedding-3-large](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models) model for generating embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a RAG system using:\n",
    "- The [BBC News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime) containing news articles\n",
    "- Couchbase Capella as the vector store with Search Vector Index for vector index creation\n",
    "- LlamaIndex framework for the RAG pipeline\n",
    "- OpenAI for embeddings and text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage Couchbase's Search Vector Index to create and manage vector indexes, enabling efficient semantic search capabilities. The Search Vector Index provides the infrastructure for storing, indexing, and querying high-dimensional vector embeddings alongside traditional text search functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional RAG system using OpenAI Services and LlamaIndex."

    "### Couchbase Capella Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a multi-node Capella cluster running the Data, Query, Index, and Search services.\n",
    "* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.\n",
    "* [Allow access](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html) to the Cluster from the IP on which the application is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI Models Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the RAG application, we need an embedding model to ingest the documents for Vector Search and a large language model (LLM) for generating the responses based on the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation, we'll use OpenAI's models which provide state-of-the-art performance for both embeddings and text generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding Model**: We'll use OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-large` model, which provides high-quality embeddings with 3,072 dimensions for semantic search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Language Model**: We'll use OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model for generating responses based on the retrieved context. This model offers excellent reasoning capabilities and can handle complex queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites for OpenAI Integration**:\n",
    "* Create an OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)\n",
    "* Generate an API key from your OpenAI dashboard\n",
    "* Ensure you have sufficient credits or a valid payment method set up\n",
    "* Set up your API key as an environment variable or input it securely in the notebook\n",
    "\n",

Just a day earlier, faith healer Bibi - wrapped in a white shawl, her face covered by a white veil - stood atop a shipping container on the edge of the city as thousands of her husband’s devoted followers waved flags and chanted slogans beneath her. It was the latest protest to flare since Khan, the 72-year-old cricketing icon-turned-politician, was jailed more than a year ago after falling foul of the country\\'s influential military which helped catapult him to power. “My children and my brothers! You have to stand with me,” Bibi cried on Tuesday afternoon, her voice cutting through the deafening roar of the crowd. “But even if you don’t,” she continued, “I will still stand firm. “This is not just about my husband. It is about this country and its leader.” It was, noted some watchers of Pakistani politics, her political debut. But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there was no sign of Bibi, nor the thousands of protesters who had marched through the country to the heart of the capital, demanding the release of their jailed leader. While other PMs have fallen out with Pakistan\\'s military in the past, Khan\\'s refusal to stay quiet behind bars is presenting an extraordinary challenge - escalating the standoff and leaving the country deeply divided. Exactly what happened to the so-called “final march”, and Bibi, when the city went dark is still unclear. All eyewitnesses like Samia* can say for certain is that the lights went out suddenly, plunging D Chowk, the square where they had gathered, into blackness.\\n\\nWithin a day of arriving, the protesters had scattered - leaving behind Bibi\\'s burnt-out vehicle\\n\\nAs loud screams and clouds of tear gas blanketed the square, Samia describes holding her husband on the pavement, bloodied from a gun shot to his shoulder. \"Everyone was running for their lives,\" she later told BBC Urdu from a hospital in Islamabad, adding it was \"like doomsday or a war\". \"His blood was on my hands and the screams were unending.” But how did the tide turn so suddenly and decisively? Just hours earlier, protesters finally reached D Chowk late afternoon on Tuesday. They had overcome days of tear gas shelling and a maze of barricaded roads to get to the city centre.

The authorities have have denied firing at the protesters. They also said some of the protesters were carrying firearms. The BBC has seen hospital records recording patients with gunshot injuries. However, government spokesperson Attaullah Tarar told the BBC that hospitals had denied receiving or treating gunshot wound victims. He added that \"all security personnel deployed on the ground have been forbidden\" from having live ammunition during protests. But one doctor told BBC Urdu that he had never done so many surgeries for gunshot wounds in a single night. \"Some of the injured came in such critical condition that we had to start surgery right away instead of waiting for anaesthesia,\" he said. While there has been no official toll released, the BBC has confirmed with local hospitals that at least five people have died. Police say at least 500 protesters were arrested that night and are being held in police stations. The PTI claims some people are missing. And one person in particular hasn’t been seen in days: Bushra Bibi.\\n\\nThe next morning, the protesters were gone - leaving behind just wrecked cars and smashed glass\\n\\nOthers defended her. “It wasn’t her fault,” insisted another. “She was forced to leave by the party leaders.” Political commentators have been more scathing. “Her exit damaged her political career before it even started,” said Mehmal Sarfraz, a journalist and analyst. But was that even what she wanted? Khan has previously dismissed any thought his wife might have her own political ambitions - “she only conveys my messages,” he said in a statement attributed to him on his X account.\\n\\nImran Khan and Bushra Bibi, pictured here arriving at court in May 2023, married in 2018\\n\\nSpeaking to BBC Urdu, analyst Imtiaz Gul calls her participation “an extraordinary step in extraordinary circumstances\". Gul believes Bushra Bibi’s role today is only about “keeping the party and its workers active during Imran Khan’s absence”. It is a feeling echoed by some PTI members, who believe she is “stepping in only because Khan trusts her deeply”. Insiders, though, had often whispered that she was pulling the strings behind the scenes - advising her husband on political appointments and guiding high-stakes decisions during his tenure. A more direct intervention came for the first time earlier this month, when she urged a meeting of PTI leaders to back Khan’s call for a rally. Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif accused her of “opportunism”, claiming she sees “a future for herself as a political leader”. But Asma Faiz, an associate professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences, suspects the PTI’s leadership may have simply underestimated Bibi. “It was assumed that there was an understanding that she is a non-political person, hence she will not be a threat,” she told the AFP news agency. “However, the events of the last few days have shown a different side of Bushra Bibi.” But it probably doesn’t matter what analysts and politicians think. Many PTI supporters still see her as their connection to Imran Khan. It was clear her presence was enough to electrify the base. “She is the one who truly wants to get him out,” says Asim Ali, a resident of Islamabad. “I trust her. Absolutely!”', 'Walleys Quarry was ordered not to accept any new waste as of Friday\\n\\nA chemist and former senior lecturer in environmental sustainability has said powerful odours from a controversial landfill site may be linked to people doing more DIY during the Covid-19 pandemic. Complaints about Walleys Quarry in Silverdale, Staffordshire – which was ordered to close as of Friday – increased significantly during and after coronavirus lockdowns. Issuing the closure notice, the Environment Agency described management of the site as poor, adding it had exhausted all other enforcement tactics at premises where gases had been noxious and periodically above emission level guidelines - which some campaigners linked to ill health locally. Dr Sharon George, who used to teach at Keele University, said she had been to the site with students and found it to be clean and well-managed, and suggested an increase in plasterboard heading to landfills in 2020 could be behind a spike in stenches.\\n\\n“One of the materials that is particularly bad for producing odours and awful emissions is plasterboard,\" she said. “That’s one of the theories behind why Walleys Quarry got worse at that time.” She said the landfill was in a low-lying area, and that some of the gases that came from the site were quite heavy. “They react with water in the atmosphere, so some of the gases you smell can be quite awful and not very good for our health. “It’s why, on some days when it’s colder and muggy and a bit misty, you can smell it more.” Dr George added: “With any landfill, you’re putting things into the ground – and when you put things into the ground, if they can they will start to rot. When they start to rot they’re going to give off gases.” She believed Walleys Quarry’s proximity to people’s homes was another major factor in the amount of complaints that arose from its operation. “If you’ve got a gas that people can smell, they’re going to report it much more than perhaps a pollutant that might go unnoticed.”\\n\\nRebecca Currie said she did not think the site would ever be closed\\n\\nLocal resident and campaigner Rebecca Currie said the closure notice served to Walleys Quarry was \"absolutely amazing\". Her son Matthew has had breathing difficulties after being born prematurely with chronic lung disease, and Ms Currie says the site has made his symptoms worse. “I never thought this day was going to happen,” she explained. “We fought and fought for years.” She told BBC Midlands Today: “Our community have suffered. We\\'ve got kids who are really poorly, people have moved homes.”\\n\\nComplaints about Walleys Quarry to Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council exceeded 700 in November, the highest amount since 2021 according to council leader Simon Tagg. The Environment Agency (EA), which is responsible for regulating landfill sites, said it had concluded further operation at the site could result in \"significant long-term pollution\". A spokesperson for Walley\\'s Quarry Ltd said the firm rejected the EA\\'s accusations of poor management, and would be challenging the closure notice. Dr George said she believed the EA was likely to be erring on the side of caution and public safety, adding safety standards were strict. She said a lack of landfill space in the country overall was one of the broader issues that needed addressing. “As people, we just keep using stuff and then have nowhere to put it, and then when we end up putting it in places like Walleys Quarry that is next to houses, I think that’s where the problems are.”\\n\\nTell us which stories we should cover in Staffordshire'], 'link': ['http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg02lvj1e7o', 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yg1v16nkpo'], 'top_image': ['https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/9975/live/b22229e0-ad5a-11ef-83bc-1153ed943d1c.jpg', 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/0896/live/55209f80-adb2-11ef-8f6c-f1a86bb055ec.jpg']}\n"

      "A charred lorry, empty tear gas shells and posters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan - it was all that remained of a massive protest led by Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, that had sent the entire capital into lockdown. Just a day earlier, faith healer Bibi - wrapped in a white shawl, her face covered by a white veil - stood atop a shipping container on the edge of the city as thousands of her husband’s devoted followers waved flags and chanted slogans beneath her. It was the latest protest to flare since Khan, the 72-year-old cricketing icon-turned-politician, was jailed more than a year ago after falling foul of the country's influential military which helped catapult him to power. “My children and my brothers! You have to stand with me,” Bibi cried on Tuesday afternoon, her voice cutting through the deafening roar of the crowd. “But even if you don’t,” she continued, “I will still stand firm. “This is not just about my husband. It is about this country and its leader.” It was, noted some watchers of Pakistani politics, her political debut. But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there was no sign of Bibi, nor the thousands of protesters who had marched through the country to the heart of the capital, demanding the release of their jailed leader. While other PMs have fallen out with Pakistan's military in the past, Khan's refusal to stay quiet behind bars is presenting an extraordinary challenge - escalating the standoff and leaving the country deeply divided. Exactly what happened to the so-called “final march”, and Bibi, when the city went dark is still unclear.

The authorities have have denied firing at the protesters. They also said some of the protesters were carrying firearms. The BBC has seen hospital records recording patients with gunshot injuries. However, government spokesperson Attaullah Tarar told the BBC that hospitals had denied receiving or treating gunshot wound victims. He added that \"all security personnel deployed on the ground have been forbidden\" from having live ammunition during protests. But one doctor told BBC Urdu that he had never done so many surgeries for gunshot wounds in a single night. \"Some of the injured came in such critical condition that we had to start surgery right away instead of waiting for anaesthesia,\" he said. While there has been no official toll released, the BBC has confirmed with local hospitals that at least five people have died. Police say at least 500 protesters were arrested that night and are being held in police stations. The PTI claims some people are missing. And one person in particular hasn’t been seen in days: Bushra Bibi.\n",

      "The next morning, the protesters were gone - leaving behind just wrecked cars and smashed glass\n",
      "\n",
      "Others defended her. “It wasn’t her fault,” insisted another. “She was forced to leave by the party leaders.” Political commentators have been more scathing. “Her exit damaged her political career before it even started,” said Mehmal Sarfraz, a journalist and analyst. But was that even what she wanted? Khan has previously dismissed any thought his wife might have her own political ambitions - “she only conveys my messages,” he said in a statement attributed to him on his X account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi, pictured here arriving at court in May 2023, married in 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to BBC Urdu, analyst Imtiaz Gul calls her participation “an extraordinary step in extraordinary circumstances\". Gul believes Bushra Bibi’s role today is only about “keeping the party and its workers active during Imran Khan’s absence”. It is a feeling echoed by some PTI members, who believe she is “stepping in only because Khan trusts her deeply”. Insiders, though, had often whispered that she was pulling the strings behind the scenes - advising her husband on political appointments and guiding high-stakes decisions during his tenure. A more direct intervention came for the first time earlier this month, when she urged a meeting of PTI leaders to back Khan’s call for a rally. Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif accused her of “opportunism”, claiming she sees “a future for herself as a political leader”. But Asma Faiz, an associate professor of political science at Lahore University of Management Sciences, suspects the PTI’s leadership may have simply underestimated Bibi. “It was assumed that there was an understanding that she is a non-political person, hence she will not be a threat,” she told the AFP news agency. “However, the events of the last few days have shown a different side of Bushra Bibi.” But it probably doesn’t matter what analysts and politicians think. Many PTI supporters still see her as their connection to Imran Khan. It was clear her presence was enough to electrify the base. “She is the one who truly wants to get him out,” says Asim Ali, a resident of Islamabad. “I trust her. Absolutely!”\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've built a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Couchbase Capella, Openai and LlamaIndex. We used the BBC News dataset, which contains real-time news articles, to demonstrate how RAG can be used to answer questions about current events and provide up-to-date information that extends beyond the LLM's training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of our RAG system include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Couchbase Capella** as the vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings\n",
    "2. **LlamaIndex** as the framework for connecting our data to the LLM\n",
    "3. **OpenAI Services** for generating embeddings (`text-embedding-3-large`) and LLM responses (`gpt-4o`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to enhance the capabilities of large language models by grounding their responses in specific, up-to-date information from our knowledge base. "
