We will use the [e5-mistral-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct) model for generating embeddings via the Capella AI Services.\n",

    "\n",
    "When running Couchbase using [Capella](https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-in), the following prerequisites need to be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a multi-node Capella cluster running the Data, Query, Index, and Search services.\n",
    "* Create the [database credentials](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) to access the bucket (Read and Write) used in the application.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Deploy Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the RAG application, we need an embedding model to ingest the documents for Vector Search and a large language model (LLM) for generating the responses based on the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Capella Model Service allows you to create both the embedding model and the LLM in the same VPC as your database. Currently, the service offers Llama 3.1 Instruct model with 8 Billion parameters as an LLM and the mistral model for embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create the models using the Capella AI Services interface. While creating the model, it is possible to cache the responses (both standard and semantic cache) and apply guardrails to the LLM responses.\n",

We'll be using the `Llama3.1-8B-Instruct` large language model via the Capella AI services inside the same network as the Capella operational database to process user queries and generate meaningful responses. This model is a key component of our RAG system, allowing it to go beyond simple keyword matching and truly understand the intent behind a query. By creating this language model, we equip our RAG system with the ability to interpret complex queries, understand the nuances of language, and provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
