# Couchbase Capella AI Services Auto-Vectorization with LangChain

This guide is a comprehensive tutorial demonstrating how to use Couchbase Capella's AI Services auto-vectorization feature to automatically convert your data into vector embeddings and perform semantic search using LangChain.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The main tutorial is contained in the Jupyter notebook `autovec_langchain.ipynb`, which walks you through:

1. **Couchbase Capella Setup** - Creating account, cluster, and access controls
2. **Data Upload & Processing** - Using sample data
3. **Model Deployment** - Deploying embedding models for vectorization
4. **Auto-Vectorization Workflow** - Setting up automated embedding generation
5. **LangChain Integration** - Building semantic search applications with vector similarity

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
