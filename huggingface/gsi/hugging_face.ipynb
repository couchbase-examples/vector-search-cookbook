    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) as the AI-powered embedding model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval.\n",

    "This tutorial demonstrates how to leverage Couchbase's **Global Secondary Index (GSI) vector search capabilities** with Hugging Face embeddings to create a high-performance semantic search system. GSI vector search in Couchbase offers significant advantages over traditional FTS (Full-Text Search) approaches, particularly for vector-first workloads and scenarios requiring complex filtering with high query-per-second (QPS) performance.\n",
