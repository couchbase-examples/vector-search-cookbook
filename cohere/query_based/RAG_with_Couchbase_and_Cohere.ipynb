    "## Introduction\nIn this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)\n as the AI-powered embedding and language model provider. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system using Couchbase Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index from scratch. Alternatively if you want to perform semantic search using the Search Vector Index, please take a look at [this.](https://developer.couchbase.com/tutorial-cohere-couchbase-rag-with-search-vector-index)"

This batch processing approach helps manage memory usage and provides better control over the ingestion process.\n\nWe first filter out any articles that exceed 50,000 characters to avoid potential issues with token limits. Then, using the vector store's add_texts method, we add the filtered articles to our vector database. The batch_size parameter controls how many articles are processed in each iteration.\n\nThis approach offers several benefits:\n1. Memory Efficiency: Processing in smaller batches prevents memory overload\n2. Progress Tracking: Easier to monitor and track the ingestion progress\n3. Resource Management: Better control over CPU and network resource utilization\n\nWe use a conservative batch size of 50 to ensure reliable operation.\nThe optimal batch size depends on many factors including:\n- Document sizes being inserted\n- Available system resources\n- Network conditions\n- Concurrent workload\n\nConsider measuring performance with your specific workload before adjusting.\n"

    "## Perform Semantic Search\nSemantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined. Common metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product, but other metrics can be implemented based on specific use cases. Different embedding models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe can also be used depending on the application's needs, with the vectors generated by these models stored and searched within Couchbase itself.\n\nIn the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the `similarity_search_with_score` method of the `CouchbaseQueryVectorStore`. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and the distance that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

      "\n",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says he is \"fine\" despite admitting his sleep and diet are being affected by the worst run of results in his entire managerial career. In an interview with former Italy international Luca Toni for Amazon Prime Sport before Wednesday's Champions League defeat by Juventus, Guardiola touched on the personal impact City's sudden downturn in form has had. Guardiola said his state of mind was \"ugly\", that his sleep was \"worse\" and he was eating lighter as his digestion had suffered. City go into Sunday's derby against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium having won just one of their past 10 games. The Juventus loss means there is a chance they may not even secure a play-off spot in the Champions League. Asked to elaborate on his comments to Toni, Guardiola said: \"I'm fine. \"In our jobs we always want to do our best or the best as possible. When that doesn't happen you are more uncomfortable than when the situation is going well, always that happened. \"In good moments I am happier but when I get to the next game I am still concerned about what I have to do. There is no human being that makes an activity and it doesn't matter how they do.\" Guardiola said City have to defend better and \"avoid making mistakes at both ends\". To emphasise his point, Guardiola referred back to the third game of City's current run, against a Sporting side managed by Ruben Amorim, who will be in the United dugout at the weekend. City dominated the first half in Lisbon, led thanks to Phil Foden's early effort and looked to be cruising. Instead, they conceded three times in 11 minutes either side of half-time as Sporting eventually ran out 4-1 winners. \"I would like to play the game like we played in Lisbon on Sunday, believe me,\" said Guardiola, who is facing the prospect of only having three fit defenders for the derby as Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji try to overcome injury concerns. If there is solace for City, it comes from the knowledge United are not exactly flying. Their comeback Europa League victory against Viktoria Plzen on Thursday was their third win of Amorim's short reign so far but only one of those successes has come in the Premier League, where United have lost their past two games against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest. Nevertheless, Guardiola can see improvements already on the red side of the city. \"It's already there,\" he said. \"You see all the patterns, the movements, the runners and the pace. He will do a good job at United, I'm pretty sure of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Guardiola says skipper Kyle Walker has been offered support by the club after the City defender highlighted the racial abuse he had received on social media in the wake of the Juventus trip. \"It's unacceptable,\" he said. \"Not because it's Kyle - for any human being. \"Unfortunately it happens many times in the real world. It is not necessary to say he has the support of the entire club. It is completely unacceptable and we give our support to him.\"\n",

      "Manchester City are currently in relegation form and there is little sign of it ending. Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa left them joint bottom of the form table over the past eight games with just Southampton for company. Saints, at the foot of the Premier League, have the same number of points, four, as City over their past eight matches having won one, drawn one and lost six - the same record as the floundering champions. And if Southampton - who appointed Ivan Juric as their new manager on Saturday - get at least a point at Fulham on Sunday, City will be on the worst run in the division. Even Wolves, who sacked boss Gary O'Neil last Sunday and replaced him with Vitor Pereira, have earned double the number of points during the same period having played a game fewer. They are damning statistics for Pep Guardiola, even if he does have some mitigating circumstances with injuries to Ederson, Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias - who all missed the loss at Villa Park - and the long-term loss of midfield powerhouse Rodri. Guardiola was happy with Saturday's performance, despite defeat in Birmingham, but there is little solace to take at slipping further out of the title race. He may have needed to field a half-fit Manuel Akanji and John Stones at Villa Park but that does not account for City looking a shadow of their former selves. That does not justify the error Josko Gvardiol made to gift Jhon Duran a golden chance inside the first 20 seconds, or £100m man Jack Grealish again failing to have an impact on a game. There may be legitimate reasons for City's drop off, whether that be injuries, mental fatigue or just simply a team coming to the end of its lifecycle, but their form, which has plunged off a cliff edge, would have been unthinkable as they strolled to a fourth straight title last season. \"The worrying thing is the number of goals conceded,\" said ex-England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Match of the Day. \"The number of times they were opened up because of the lack of protection and legs in midfield was staggering. There are so many things that are wrong at this moment in time.\"\n",

      "Afterwards Guardiola was calm, so much so it was difficult to hear him in the news conference, a contrast to the frustrated figure he cut on the touchline. He said: \"It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult. We are going to try next game - another opportunity and we don't think much further than that. \"Of course there are more reasons. We concede the goals we don't concede in the past, we [don't] score the goals we score in the past. Football is not just one reason. There are a lot of little factors. \"Last season we won the Premier League, but we came here and lost. We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys. Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back.\" Villa boss Unai Emery highlighted City's frailties, saying he felt Villa could seize on the visitors' lack of belief. \"Manchester City are a little bit under the confidence they have normally,\" he said. \"The second half was different, we dominated and we scored. Through those circumstances they were feeling worse than even in the first half.\"\n",

He told TNT after the game: \"Of course, [confidence levels are] not the best. We know how important confidence is and you can see that it affects every human being. That is how it is, we have to continue and stay positive even though it is difficult.\" Haaland, with 76 goals in 83 Premier League appearances since joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, had one shot and one touch in the Villa box. His 18 touches in the whole game were the lowest of all starting players and he has been self critical, despite scoring 13 goals in the top flight this season. Over City's last eight games he has netted just twice though, but Guardiola refused to criticise his star striker. He said: \"Without him we will be even worse but I like the players feeling that way. I don't agree with Erling. He needs to have the balls delivered in the right spots but he will fight for the next one.\"\n",

    "## Optimizing Vector Search with Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index\n\nWhile the above semantic search using similarity_search_with_score works effectively, we can significantly improve query performance by leveraging Couchbase's query-based vector indexing.\n\nCouchbase offers three types of vector indexes, but for Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index based search we focus on two main types:\n\nHyperscale Vector Indexes\n- Best for pure vector searches - content discovery, recommendations, semantic search\n- High performance with low memory footprint - designed to scale to billions of vectors\n- Optimized for concurrent operations - supports simultaneous searches and inserts\n- Use when: You primarily perform vector-only queries without complex scalar filtering\n- Ideal for: Large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, content discovery\n\nComposite Vector Indexes \n- Best for filtered vector searches - combines vector search with scalar value filtering\n- Efficient pre-filtering - scalar attributes reduce the vector comparison scope\n- Use when: Your queries combine vector similarity with scalar filters that eliminate large portions of data\n- Ideal for: Compliance-based filtering, user-specific searches, time-bounded queries\n\nChoosing the Right Index Type\n- Start with Hyperscale Vector Index for pure vector searches and large datasets\n- Use Composite Vector Index when scalar filters significantly reduce your search space\n- Consider your dataset size: Hyperscale scales to billions, Composite works well for tens of millions to billions\n\nFor more details, see the [Couchbase Vector Index documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/use-vector-indexes.html).\n\n\n## Understanding Index Configuration (Couchbase 8.0 Feature)\n\nThe index_description parameter controls how Couchbase optimizes vector storage and search performance through centroids and quantization:\n\nFormat: `'IVF[<centroids>],{PQ|SQ}<settings>'`\n\nCentroids (IVF - Inverted File):\n- Controls how the dataset is subdivided for faster searches\n- More centroids = faster search, slower training  \n- Fewer centroids = slower search, faster training\n- If omitted (like IVF,SQ8), Couchbase auto-selects based on dataset size\n\nQuantization Options:\n- SQ (Scalar Quantization): SQ4, SQ6, SQ8 (4, 6, or 8 bits per dimension)\n- PQ (Product Quantization): PQ<subquantizers>x<bits> (e.g., PQ32x8)\n- Higher values = better accuracy, larger index size\n\nCommon Examples:\n- IVF,SQ8 - Auto centroids, 8-bit scalar quantization (good default)\n- IVF1000,SQ6 - 1000 centroids, 6-bit scalar quantization  \n- IVF,PQ32x8 - Auto centroids, 32 subquantizers with 8 bits\n\nFor detailed configuration options, see the [Quantization & Centroid Settings](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/vector-index/hyperscale-vector-index.html#algo_settings).\n\nIn the code below, we demonstrate creating a Hyperscale index. This method takes an index type (HYPERSCALE or COMPOSITE) and description parameter for optimization settings. Alternatively, Hyperscale and Composite Vector Indexes can be created manually from the Couchbase UI."

Lower distance indicate higher similarity, while higher distance indicate lower similarity."

    "## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Couchbase and Langchain\nCouchbase and LangChain can be seamlessly integrated to create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chains, enhancing the process of generating contextually relevant responses. In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a generative language model within LangChain.\n\nThe language model, equipped with the context from the retrieved documents, generates a response that is both informed and contextually accurate. This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase’s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while LangChain handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation."

    "## Using Couchbase as a caching mechanism\nCouchbase can be effectively used as a caching mechanism for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) responses by storing and retrieving precomputed results for specific queries. This approach enhances the system's efficiency and speed, particularly when dealing with repeated or similar queries. When a query is first processed, the RAG chain retrieves relevant documents, generates a response using the language model, and then stores this response in Couchbase, with the query serving as the key.\n\nFor subsequent requests with the same query, the system checks Couchbase first. If a cached response is found, it is retrieved directly from Couchbase, bypassing the need to re-run the entire RAG process. This significantly reduces response time because the computationally expensive steps of document retrieval and response generation are skipped. Couchbase's role in this setup is to provide a fast and scalable storage solution for caching these responses, ensuring that frequently asked queries can be answered more quickly and efficiently."
