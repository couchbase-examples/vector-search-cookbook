title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Couchbase and Cohere using Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index
short_title: Cohere RAG with Query Vector Index
description:
  - Learn how to build a semantic search engine using Couchbase and Cohere using Hyperscale and Composite Vector Index.
  - This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Couchbase's vector search capabilities with Cohere embeddings and language models.
  - You'll understand how to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and Couchbase.
